            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>IT is fit I ſhould acquaint the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, in the firſt place, with the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of the following Notes; And I am the more inclined ſo to do, that it may appear that I have not been forward to make them publick, and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious of appearing in Print.</p>
                  <p>Many years are now paſſed, ſince a conſiderable number of the Clergy of <hi>London</hi> met together, and agreed to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh ſome ſhort Notes upon the whole Bible for the Uſe of Families, and of all thoſe well-diſpoſed Perſons that deſired to read the Holy Scriptures to their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt advantage. At that Meeting they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon this worthy deſign, and took their ſeveral ſhares, and aſſigned ſome
<pb n="II" facs="tcp:94724:3"/> part to them who were abſent. I was not preſent at that Meeting, but I was ſoon informed that they had aſſigned to me the <hi>Pentateuch.</hi> I was very ſenſible how great a Task this would prove, and was ſufficiently conſcious of my own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects; Yet was I willing to undertake it, becauſe I did always hope, that by yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it, I might incourage the Labours of thoſe who would exceed what-ever I was able to do. Upon this conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I did ſet about this Work, and did often declare (and with great ſincerity) that this was the Motive which did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce me.</p>
                  <p>The Work was begun with common conſent, and we did frequently meet, and what was done was communicated from time to time to thoſe met together, and that were concerned. The Methods of proceeding had been adjuſted, and agreed to; A Specimen was printed, and an agreement was made when it ſhould be put to the Preſs; and I finiſhed my Part in order thereunto.</p>
                  <pb n="III" facs="tcp:94724:3"/>
                  <p>But ſo it fell out, that, ſoon after all this, the Clouds began to gather a-pace, and there was great ground to fear that the Popiſh Party was attempting to ruin the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and that there was a ſevere Storm from that Quarter lighting upon us. We were alarm'd with their Plots and Conſpiracies, and ſometime after ſaw that Party encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the Higher Powers. Thoſe of that Party preached and printed, and had their ſeparate Meetings, and drew away ſome of our People, and more were in danger of being ſeduced. Hence it came to paſs, that the thoughts of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing the above-mentioned deſign were at preſent laid aſide; and thoſe that were concerned in it, were now obliged to turn their Studies and Pens againſt that dangerous Enemy: And what was done at that time, and upon that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, by thoſe concerned in this Work of writing Notes on the Bible, I ſhall not need to tell the Reader in this place.</p>
                  <pb n="IV" facs="tcp:94724:4"/>
                  <p>During this time alſo, ſome number of thoſe Perſons, concerned in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-mentioned Work, were taken away by Death: And thus the Work was hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, that might elſe have been finiſhed long ſince.</p>
                  <p>A Work well deſigned it was, and would have been of unſpeakable advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. And perhaps nothing could have contributed more toward the making Men wiſer, and better; And nothing was more wanting among us than ſuch a ſhort Explication of the Holy Writ; And, I am apt to believe, nothing would have been more acceptable to thoſe that are well diſpoſed than ſuch a Work. Some other hands have done ſomething this way ſince, whoſe Endeavours have not wanted very conſiderable encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It would alſo have been of great uſe to the Undertakers themſelves, as it would have engaged them in thoſe Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which, of all others, are moſt enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to all Men that are truly Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual. The ſtudying of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="V" facs="tcp:94724:4"/> is the beſt imployment for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in Holy things, and for the People alſo. And they that apply themſelves diligently this way, will be beſt able to defend the Holy Writings againſt Gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayers, and to deal with the Enemies of the Reformed Religion.</p>
                  <p>And I having drawn up my Notes upon this occaſion, do now think my ſelf obliged to make them publick, God having now diſperſed thoſe Clouds that then hung over our heads. And I do it from the ſame Motive that firſt indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced me to undertake it; <hi>viz.</hi> that I might draw on others to do much better in the following Books. I am very willing to hope, that, in due time, the reſt will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in the ſame kind of Volume that theſe appear in: I can hardly think that a Work ſo well deviſed will fall to the ground, and will do any thing in my power to revive what was ſo well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived at firſt.</p>
                  <p>I cannot but ſay ſomething in this place (beſides what I intimated before)
<pb n="VI" facs="tcp:94724:5"/> of the great Uſefulneſs and Neceſſity of ſome ſhort and eaſie Notes upon the Bible for the Uſe of Families. Perhaps 'tis that which, of all other things, is moſt wanting, and moſt deſerves the utmoſt care of the Governors and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructors of the Church.</p>
                  <p>We are agreed that the People ought to read the Holy Scriptures, and they are therefore Tranſlated into the Vulgar Tongue. They do read them, and there is nothing wanting now but ſuch an help as may enable them to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them, and gain the greateſt bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by them. They muſt be often at a ſtand, and may anſwer as the <hi>Eunuch</hi> anſwered <hi>Philip,</hi> when he ſaid, <hi>Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeſt thou what thou readeſt?</hi> And he ſaid, <hi>How can I, except ſome Man ſhould guide me?</hi> Act. 8.30, 31. There are in the Holy Books ſome things hard to be underſtood: And other things there are that are very liable to be miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood: And ſometimes a miſtake is of a dangerous, ſometimes of a fatal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence.
<pb n="VII" facs="tcp:94724:5"/> There are ſome Men that ſet up for Wits, that Cavil at theſe Holy Books, and pretend to have diſcovered Flaws or Inconſiſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ncies in them. Theſe little Wits run away with this conceit, that they have juſt Exceptions againſt theſe Books; they ſcatter their poiſon, and prevail upon the profane and the ignorant: All this miſchief, and very much more, might have been prevented by laying things in their true light, and informing the diligent Reader of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures with the true ſenſe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of the place. By this means we muſt ſtop the mouths of fooliſh Men, and prevent the falling of the weak.</p>
                  <p>There have been of late years great attempts to diſparage and leſſen the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem of the Holy Writ, and <hi>Moſes</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hath not been ſpared on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. I am of opinion, after all, that theſe attempts have not done any harm to wiſe and ſtable Souls. Theſe Men think as Honourably of theſe Writings
<pb n="VIII" facs="tcp:94724:6"/> as they did before. But yet a great number of our People have been ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced: And the unſtable and unlearned have wreſted the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oly Scriptures to their own deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>The Scriptures need not fear the moſt ſubtle Enemies, They may be defended againſt the Sophiſtry of thoſe that wou'd render them deſpicable and ridiculous. The Defence, which the Reader will find in the following Papers, of <hi>Moſes</hi> as the Writer of the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> againſt the Objections of the profeſſed and moſt famed Writers of this laſt Age, will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince any indifferent Reader that theſe Men had no Wit to ſpare. 'Tis an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie thing for a profane Man to ſcoff at the Scriptures; and for a Wit to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his Reader or his Hearer with his Drollery on this occaſion. But ſtill here's nothing to be found that will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger the wiſe and the ſtable.</p>
                  <p>However, we are in the mean time to take care of our Brethren, and of ſuch of them eſpecially as are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="IX" facs="tcp:94724:6"/> to our Care and Charge. And 'tis high time now to defend our Common Religion againſt the profeſſed Enemies of what is <hi>Revealed.</hi> 'Tis high time to encourage the <hi>Bible</hi>-learning; I mean all thoſe Studies that will enable Men better to underſtand and defend the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures. We have long enough uſed our Pens againſt one another, and fully ſhewn the Vanity of thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who in the late times attempted us. It well becomes us now to turn our Thoughts and Studies ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way.</p>
                  <p>As our Church hath dealt very ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely in allowing the People the Uſe of the Scriptures in their Vulgar Tongue; ſo, 'tis manifeſt, that nothing can be of greater uſe than the commending to them ſome eaſie and plain, and well-conſidered Explication thereof. When the Law was read to the People, after their return from <hi>Babylon,</hi> in the days of <hi>Ezra,</hi> the Names of thoſe Men are mentioned, <hi>who cauſed the People to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
<pb n="X" facs="tcp:94724:7"/> the Law.</hi> It follows, <hi>So they read in the Book of the Law of God diſtinctly, and gave the ſenſe, and cauſed</hi> them <hi>to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the reading,</hi> Nehem. 8.7, 8. The <hi>Jews,</hi> when they were return'd from their Captivity in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and had in ſome meaſure forgotten their own Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, needed ſuch an Explication: And hence (it hath been thought) it was that the <hi>Targums,</hi> or Chaldee Paraphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſprang.</p>
                  <p>An exact and diligent ſtudying of the Scriptures, and leading the People into a good underſtanding of them, will prevent many miſchiefs which we have laboured under. It will enable us to underſtand the Queſtions agitated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Chriſtians much better; it will divert us from that Contentious Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy that is fruitleſs, and very perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; 'Twill tend immediately to furniſh us with uſefull Knowledge, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able us to defend our Religion againſt the Common Enemy; 'Twill prevent many of our Diſputes, put an end to
<pb n="XI" facs="tcp:94724:7"/> much of our Schiſm and unneceſſary Separation; and very much conduce to the introducing a better Spirit among us.</p>
                  <p>But I would not be miſtaken. I do not think 'tis fit that every Man ſhould be allowed to write Commentaries on the Bible: What I plead for, is this, That ſomething of this ſhould be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Governors of the Church, and that after the matureſt Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the whole matter. 'Tis not the Scripture hath done hurt to the World, what-ever our Adverſaries affirm: 'Tis the miſunderſtanding and miſapplying them that hath done it: And hence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed many miſchiefs have a-riſen, which might by this care be in great meaſure prevented for the future.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true; Our People have the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures Tranſlated: And this Tranſlation is a very good one: They have alſo a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal reading, very often, to help them to underſtand them: And ſometimes they have alſo Bibles, with uſefull Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences,
<pb n="XII" facs="tcp:94724:8"/> for their farther aſſiſtance. I readily own that theſe are great Bleſſings. But ſtill the diligent Reader of the Holy Scripture ſhould be farther encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</p>
                  <p>For the Tranſlation of the Bible which we uſe, it is very excellent; I am apt to believe 'tis inferior to none, either an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient or modern. The Memory of thoſe Perſons who laboured in it, ought to be precious. Yet after all, there may be ſome things in it that require farther conſideration. And admitting it to be the beſt Verſion in the World, it will be neceſſary that the Pious Reader ſhou'd have ſome farther aſſiſtance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the better underſtanding of theſe Holy Books. For though a good Man that is diligent will find enough here to carry him to Heaven, if he be carefull to practiſe what he reads, and may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily underſtand; yet ſtill there will of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten occurr to him ſeveral things here that wou'd require ſome Explication to make it more eaſie and uſefull to a well-diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="XIII" facs="tcp:94724:8"/> Reader. Perhaps 'tis a thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to give a ſtrict Verſion out of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue into the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that will not require now and then ſome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to fix and determine the Senſe, which without it will be ſomewhat ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure and doubtfull. The <hi>genius</hi> and <hi>peculiarities</hi> of one Language and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are very different; and a ſtrict Verſion is indeed but what is highly fit, but then the keeping cloſe to this will not fail to leave ſome things more doubtfull and obſcure. As for inſtance, 'tis ſaid, <hi>That becauſe the Mid-wives feared God, he made them houſes,</hi> Exod. 1.21. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Reader will be apt to think, that by <hi>THEM</hi> is meant the <hi>Mid-wives:</hi> Whereas that word referrs to the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> not to the <hi>Mid-wives:</hi> For 'tis the Maſculine Gender in the Hebrew. But the Engliſh does not diſtinguiſh the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Pronouns, as the Hebrew and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Languages do. Nor is the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to be blamed, for the Nature of
<pb n="XIV" facs="tcp:94724:9"/> the Language is ſuch as will not allow any thing better. <hi>He ſhall dwell in the Tents of Shem,</hi> Gen. 9.27. To whom <hi>He</hi> referrs, the Engliſh Reader cannot learn; a Note on the plac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And whereas there are thoſe who take offence at ſome Phraſes or Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, a ſhort Note may hinder and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all this.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, we have a Marginal read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that is often very uſefull to us. But ſtill the ordinary Reader will ſometime be at a ſtand which of the Readings ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to adhere unto; And therefore he will in this matter want farther aſſiſtance. So that here is ſtill need of ſome. Note to direct the Reader.</p>
                  <p>I grant that the <hi>References</hi> to Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel places, and to ſuch other places as will give light to the Text, are of great
<pb n="XV" facs="tcp:94724:9"/> uſe. But many times they are not ſo to the Engliſh Reader, becauſe he will not be able to diſcern the purpoſe of the Reference, and the end to which it ſerves. Whereas a ſhort Note would open the matter to him.</p>
                  <p>It will be ſaid that we have already ſeveral Commentaries on the Bible in the Engliſh Tongue; and there is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore nothing wanting of this kind. To which I anſwer, That though it be true that there are ſeveral ſuch Writings, yet is this no Objection againſt what I am pleading for. For I think 'tis fit there ſhou'd be one that ſhall be approved and recommended to the People by the Governors of the Church, and which they will be anſwerable for. For thoſe we have of this kind, ſome of them are too voluminous; and the People have not ability to purchaſe, or leiſure to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe them: Others are not perhaps ſo fitted for common uſe. But that which I inſiſt mainly upon, is this, That 'tis
<pb n="XVI" facs="tcp:94724:10"/> fit ſomething of this kind ſhould be contrived, which might ſerve the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's neceſſity to the greateſt advantage, that might be ſhort and perſpicuous, cheap and eaſie to be purchaſed, and after all ſuch as bears the ſtamp of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick allowance.</p>
                  <p>For the following Notes, I ſhall not need ſay much, having acquainted the Reader already with the Occaſion of them. Some few things I think fit to add:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> That I have all along made the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text my Rule; nor do I ſee how I could do otherwiſe. I am ſure this is agreeable to the Senſe of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and this was the Rule which our Tranſlators were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That I have never attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to advance any private Opinion, nor in the leaſt departed from my Rule, for any Conſideration whatſoever. And though I have a great Opinion both of
<pb n="XVII" facs="tcp:94724:10"/> the <hi>LXXII Interpreters</hi> (eſpecially on the <hi>Pentateuch</hi>) and no mean one of the <hi>Vulgar Latin,</hi> and have with ſome la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour compared them; yet I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways had my Eye on the Hebrew Text, as upon the Rule which was to govern me. Nothing could tempt me to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Hebrew Text, or to depart from it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I muſt own, that as to the Senſe of the Text, I have received con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable aſſiſtance from the Ancient In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters, and from the Modern; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially from the <hi>LXXII,</hi> the <hi>Vulgar</hi> and the <hi>Targum</hi> of <hi>Onkelos;</hi> (which is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally a Verſion rather than a Paraphraſe) nor hath the <hi>Syriac</hi> been forgot, and the <hi>Samaritan</hi> hath upon occaſion been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered. For the Modern Verſions, I know none better than our own in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh,</hi> that of <hi>Diodati</hi> in <hi>Italian,</hi> and the <hi>Tigurin</hi> in <hi>Latin,</hi> which have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in the following Notes.</p>
                  <pb n="XVIII" facs="tcp:94724:11"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Nor have I neglected <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus</hi> and <hi>Philo</hi> the <hi>Jew.</hi> I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered how they have rendred the words of the <hi>Pentateuch</hi> as they have cited them on occaſion, and what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther accounts they have given of many paſſages of theſe Books. Nor have I over-looked the <hi>Rabbinical</hi> Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors: And I have received great help from <hi>Maimon</hi> eſpecially, whom I have frequently conſulted, and made uſe of upon this occaſion. I am fully of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion the Writings of that <hi>Jew</hi> (next to the Sacred) are one of the greateſt Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings that the learned World hath. And that if young Divines would read his Works with due care, they would ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at a greater degree of Scripture-knowledge, than by all the other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods which are uſually taken. I do not wonder that the <hi>Jews,</hi> when they ſpeak of <hi>Moſes Maimonides,</hi> ſhould ſay, That, from <hi>Moſes</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was a <hi>Man</hi> like <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="XIX" facs="tcp:94724:11"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> I have endeavoured to make things as plain as I can to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Reader. I have ſtudied to be ſhort, and not to diſturb the Reader with <hi>hard</hi> Words, or <hi>unneceſſary</hi> Quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. For thoſe few Quotations I have, they are not taken upon Truſt, but I have conſtantly ſeen with my own Eyes.</p>
                  <p>What-ever defects there may be found in this Work, this I can truly ſay for my ſelf, That I have diligently purſued the Truth: And ſhall be very ready to liſten to any Man that ſhall ſhew the my miſtakes, and ſhall moſt readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly retract them. I have uſed what care I could to miniſter to the Neceſſities of others, and done what lies in me to this purpoſe. I am fond of no ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Opinions, have purſued no world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Advantage, and (what-ever Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure I may meet with from abroad) I am not conſcious to my ſelf of any want of diligence or integrity.</p>
                  <pb n="XX" facs="tcp:94724:12"/>
                  <p>If this will be of any uſe to others, I ſhall be well ſatisfied, and ſhall be much better pleaſed, if it ſhould be any occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to excite others to carry on the Work, which is begun, to better purpoſe, and a far greater advantage to the well-diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Readers.</p>

                  <head>A Diſſertation CONCERNING The <hi>Author,</hi> or <hi>Writer,</hi> OF THE <hi>PENTATEUCH.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>IT hath been the buſineſs and ſtudy of ſome Men, of late years, to diſparage the Holy Scriptures, and all revealed Religion. What attempts have been made to that End, is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently known. The Authority and Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe Sacred Oracles hath not onely been called in queſtion, but profeſſedly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. And thoſe who have been ſo hardy and profane as to Libel the Scriptures, have not onely eſcaped without Puniſhment or Cenſure, but they have been cried up and famed for their Performances of this kind as great Wits, and Men of wonderfull Sagacity. Their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings have been induſtriouſly ſpread: And
<pb n="XXIV" facs="tcp:94724:14"/> thoſe who ſet up for Wit, have openly avowed their disbelief of the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>The Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> have not eſcaped; They have been ſo far from it, that there have been thoſe who have given out, that the Five Books, commonly believed to be his, were never writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by him. And they pretend that they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were, nor could be, written by him. And there are three Writers of late that, in their Works, have boldly aſſerted this. Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> in his <hi>Leviathan,</hi> the Author of the Book called the <hi>Praeadamitae,</hi> and <hi>Spinoſa</hi> in his <hi>Tractatus Theologico-Politicus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This matter is of great moment, and that wherein our Common Religion is greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. It ſtrikes at the very root of it, and calls its Antiquity in queſtion, and leaves the pious Reader at a great loſs. For whereas we all own that God ſpake by <hi>Moſes,</hi> yet ſtill (if theſe Men be in the right) we ſhall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly at a loſs for the Author of theſe Books, and not know whether he were a Servant of God or not. Beſides, when the Authors of the New Teſtament quote <hi>Moſes,</hi> and our Saviour appeals to his Writings, we ſhall however be very uncertain where to find theſe Writings, if he be not allowed to be the Author of the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> and ſo will the Chriſtian Religion ſuffer at the ſame time.</p>
                  <p>My deſign in what follows, is to defend <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> againſt all the attempts that the Authors above-named have made againſt his being the
<pb n="XXV" facs="tcp:94724:14"/> Author of the following Books. This is as much as my preſent Argument does oblige me to. I am not obliged operoſely to prove <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> to be the Author or Writer of the <hi>Penta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teuch.</hi> He is in poſſeſſion of that Title. It hath been allowed from the higheſt Antiquity, own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all ſorts of Men, <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> by <hi>Infidels</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi> by Men of all <hi>Sects</hi> and <hi>Parties,</hi> by Men that in other things have dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered greatly from one another. But that I may not ſeem to have neglected any thing of <hi>moment</hi> in this matter, I ſhall, before I proceed any farther, ſhew what good reaſon we have to believe that <hi>Moſes</hi> was the Writer of theſe Books, and then I ſhall conſider the force of thoſe Objections which have been produced againſt it.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt part of my deſign, I need not ſay much, both becauſe it hath been made out by others beyond all exception, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the thing is attended with as great Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence as can be reaſonably expected by any that are unprejudiced.</p>
                  <p>It is certain that <hi>Moſes</hi> wrote the Law, and (as will appear farther afterwards) that by the Law in the Scripture is meant the <hi>Pentateuch, Exod.</hi> 24.4. And delivered it to the Prieſts the Sons of <hi>Levi, Deut.</hi> 31.9. He was commanded to write, and he did it, (<hi>Exod.</hi> 17.14. with <hi>Joſh.</hi> 1.8.) I ſhall not need go over the Old Teſtament, and ſhew the many paſſages cited by the Sacred Writers of the Books thereof,
<pb n="XXVI" facs="tcp:94724:15"/> out of the ſeveral Books of the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> as the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I will (to put this matter out of doubt with all Chriſtians) paſs on to the New Teſtament, where theſe Books of the <hi>Pentateuch</hi> are quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted frequently, and they are cited as the Books of <hi>Moſes.</hi> I will not ſhew how often they are quoted in the New Teſtament, which would be more than is needfull; it will be enough to ſhew that they are cited ſeverally, as the <hi>Law,</hi> and as the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>An hiſtorical Paſſage of the Book of <hi>Geneſis</hi> is cited by St. <hi>Paul</hi> under the Character of the <hi>Law, Gal.</hi> 4.21. and the written Law that was, <hi>v.</hi> 30. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.3. St. <hi>Stephen</hi> was charged to have ſpoken blaſphemous Words a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and againſt the <hi>Law, Act.</hi> 6.11, 13. He was charged to have affirmed that <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſhould change the <hi>cuſtoms</hi> which <hi>Moſes</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, <hi>v.</hi> 14. Upon this he makes his defence, and owns his belief of the matters related, even in the Book of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> chap. 7.3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. Which had not been to his purpoſe, had not that Book been part of that <hi>Law</hi> which he was accuſed to have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken againſt, as well as againſt <hi>Moſes.</hi> Again, <hi>We have found him of whom Moſes in the Law, and the Prophets, did write,</hi> Joh. 1.45. This Law here cannot be excluſive of the Book of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> which contains the firſt, and alſo the cleareſt Prophecy of the <hi>Meſſias;</hi> of which no Chriſtian can make any doubt that conſults
<pb n="XXVII" facs="tcp:94724:15"/> 
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. and <hi>chap.</hi> 49.10. Theſe Prophecies are allowed by the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves (the great Enemies of <hi>Jeſus</hi>) to belong to the <hi>Meſſias.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Book of <hi>Exodus</hi> is by our Saviour ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly called the <hi>Book of Moſes,</hi> Mark 12.26. as it is called the <hi>Scripture</hi> by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 9.17. and the <hi>Law</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> by St. <hi>Luke,</hi> chap. 2.23.</p>

                     <hi>Leviticus</hi> is cited alſo by our Saviour as a part of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> Matt. 8.4.

For ſo indeed he did in the Book of <hi>Numbers,</hi> chap. 24.17. And farther ſtill our Saviour referrs to a paſſage re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in this Book of <hi>Numbers</hi> as a Type of himſelf: <hi>As Moſes lifted up the Serpent in the Wilderneſs, even ſo muſt the Son of Man be lifted up,</hi> Joh. 3.14.</p>

                     <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> is quoted as part of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> Matt. 19.7, 8. And what we find ſaid there, is imputed to <hi>Moſes</hi> as ſaid by him, which cannot be if he were not the Writer of it, <hi>Act.</hi>
                     <pb n="XXVIII" facs="tcp:94724:16"/> 3.22.7.37. This Book is expreſsly called the <hi>Law of Moſes,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.9. And what is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in contained, is ſaid to have been ſaid by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> Matt. 22.24.</p>
                  <p>The whole <hi>Pentateuch</hi> is included by the word <hi>Law</hi> in the ſtyle of the New Teſtament, as well as in that of the other and later Jewiſh Writers. Our Saviour ſays, <hi>That all things muſt be fulfilled which were written in the Law of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and in the Prophets, and in the Pſalms con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning me,</hi> Luk. 24.44. Whence 'tis manifeſt, that under the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> the whole <hi>Penta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teuch</hi> is comprized. For <hi>Jeſus</hi> gives us the whole Scripture, as the <hi>Jews</hi> divide it to this day. For they divide it into three parts. The <hi>Law,</hi> which taken in theſe Five Books of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> the <hi>Prophets</hi> (which the <hi>Jews</hi> divide into the former and latter) and the <hi>Kethuvim,</hi> or, Hagiographical Books. And the Book of <hi>Pſalms</hi> being the Principal of them, is put by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour here for all that fall under that General Head.</p>
                  <p>This Law came by <hi>Moſes,</hi> Joh. 1.14. He wrote it; and when the Law is read, <hi>Moſes</hi> is ſaid to be read, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.15. and <hi>chap.</hi> 15.21. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.15.</p>
                  <p>If I ſhould add to what hath been ſaid, that <hi>Moſes</hi> hath been owned to be the Writer of theſe Books by all Mankind, by all ſorts of Authors, and by an Univerſal Tradition, I think nothing can be wanting to confirm us
<pb n="XXIX" facs="tcp:94724:16"/> in this belief. And yet is this not denied by our Adverſaries in this Queſtion?</p>
                  <p>I ſhall now proceed to conſider what can be ſaid on the other ſide. The Proofs had need be very clear before <hi>Moſes</hi> can be diſpoſſeſſed of ſo juſt a claim and title, which he hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed ſo many Ages, and which is atteſted by a mighty Cloud of unexceptionable Witneſſes. We may juſtly expect that our Adverſaries, in this Queſtion, will put forth all their Might and Force, and ſtretch their Wits to the utmoſt. They will leave no means unattempted, but purſue their deſign with the greateſt vigor and application. I will draw up all their force at once, and add ſome ſcattering Supplies to them, as I have had occaſion to meet with them, that they may appear together in their full ſtrength.</p>
                  <p>Their Objections, with Anſwers to them, are theſe that follow.</p>

It is pretended that <hi>Moſes</hi> could not write thoſe words, <hi>Deut.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Theſe be the words which Moſes ſpake unto all Iſrael on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide Jordan</hi> (for it is pretended that it ought to be render'd <hi>on the other ſide,</hi> or, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Jordan) in the Wilderneſs,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe words, ſays the Objector, muſt be written by <hi>Ezra,</hi> or ſome other Perſon who liv'd in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> or at leaſt on that ſide of the River <hi>Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi>

That in this very caſe the Scripture determines the ſenſe by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſome word to direct us. There could be but two ſides of <hi>Jordan,</hi> the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt.</hi> On the latter lay <hi>Jericho</hi> and the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan.</hi> On the Eaſt-ſide was <hi>Moſes,</hi> when he ſpake the words mention'd in <hi>Deuteronomy.</hi> And we are ſometimes told what ſide is meant: the <hi>ſide</hi> toward the Riſing of the Sun, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 12.1. There is the <hi>Eaſt-ſide:</hi> We have mention of the <hi>Weſt-ſide,</hi> Joſh. 5.1. Again, of the <hi>Eaſt-ſide,</hi> chap. 13.27, 32.

The Subject-matter does direct us at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times.

                     </gap>, which there muſt ſignifie (as we have tranſlated it) <hi>on this ſide Jordan:</hi> And as the <hi>Subject-matter</hi> determines the ſenſe, ſo there is no doubt left from what follows in the next Verſe <hi>toward the Sun-riſing,</hi> Joſh. 1.14, 15. And the Subject-matter does likewiſe determine the ſenſe of this word, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 9.1. <hi>Deut.</hi> 3.8.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And as <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>Obj.</hi> II. It is pretended that <hi>Moſes</hi> could not write what we read, <hi>Gen.</hi> 36.31. <hi>Theſe are the Kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before there reigned any King over the children of Iſrael.</hi> Theſe words muſt be written ('tis pretended) by one who liv'd after there were Kings in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which was long after the Death of <hi>Moſes.</hi> I would willingly give this Objection its full ſtrength, before I anſwer it. And I find a late Writer hath done it to my hand in his <hi>Prolegomena</hi> to his Commentary on <hi>Geneſis,</hi> printed at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> 1693. The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of what he ſays is as follows: Eight Kings are reckon'd up ſucceeding each other; There were not more than ſo many Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or Perſons generated, from <hi>Jacob</hi> to <hi>Obed,</hi> the Grand-father of <hi>David.</hi> But from <hi>Jacob</hi> to <hi>Moſes</hi> there were but four, reckoning <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> for one. Then he tells what ſome anſwer; <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Moſes</hi> fore-knew that there would be Kings over <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Deut. 17. But then he does not think it credible, that God ſhould reveal to him how many Kings, and what their Names ſhou'd be that were to reign in <hi>Edom.</hi>
                     <pb n="XXXV" facs="tcp:94724:19"/> He cannot think it a Prophecy. He tells us of ſome-body (but 'tis with a <hi>Neſcio quis</hi>) who affirms theſe Kings reign'd in ſeveral places at the ſame time. He concludes (as if he had been retain'd againſt <hi>Moſes) Si candide hic a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere licet,</hi> &amp;c. That if he may deal candidly, 'tis beſt to own that the nine Verſes, from <hi>v.</hi> 31. to 39. were added by ſome-body (he might here have put another <hi>Neſcio quis</hi>) who liv'd after the Kingdom eſtabliſh'd in <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Before I go any farther, I will grant what he ſays of the Deſcents from <hi>Jacob</hi> to <hi>Obed,</hi> and from him to <hi>Moſes:</hi> I will grant the Words are not a Prophecy; and that theſe Kings reign'd ſucceſſively one after another; but will by no means allow that theſe words are not the words of <hi>Moſes.</hi> I will fully anſwer the Objection, and ſhew the falſe Reaſoning of this Author in the following Particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He might have ſpar'd his pains in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting the Deſcents from <hi>Jacob</hi> to <hi>Obed</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> as things nothing to the purpoſe. He wou'd, I know, inſinuate by it, that there was not time enough from <hi>Eſau</hi> to the times of <hi>Moſes</hi> for ſo many Kings to reign ſucceſſively; and that therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> cou'd not give us this Relation. This he ſhould have conſider'd bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter before he had given up the place. From the Marriage of <hi>Eſau,</hi> to the Death of <hi>Moſes,</hi> are no leſs than 345 years. Here's room e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for eight Kings ſucceſſively. And that there are ſo many years in this ſpace, I need
<pb n="XXXVI" facs="tcp:94724:20"/> not prove. 'Tis evident, and no Man can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it. Let any Man look over the Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> and begin where he will, and he'll ſoon find ſpace enough here for theſe eight Kings to ſucceed each other, though they had been ſucceſſively Father and Son, which they, whom <hi>Moſes</hi> mentions, were not.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. 'Tis very unfairly done to reckon from <hi>Jacob</hi> to <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Obed;</hi> and thence to inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, that there cou'd not be ſo many Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from <hi>Eſau</hi> to the Times of <hi>Moſes,</hi> who is ſuppos'd to give this Relation. This is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>Practice</hi> and <hi>Artifice.</hi> We might have looked for it from a <hi>Deiſt</hi> or a Diſciple of Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> but not from one who pretends to be an Advocate for <hi>Moſes,</hi> as this Author does. Two ways the unfairneſs of this Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice may be diſcover'd. (1.) From hence that he cannot but know that there is a great difference in theſe things. The Deſcents are more frequent in ſome Families than others, as the Perſons marry ſooner or later, as their el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt and firſt-born Sons live or die in their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Who does not know that St. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> reckons from <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Jeſus</hi> but 42 Deſcents, St. <hi>Luke</hi> 56. From <hi>Salathiel</hi> to <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> in St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> are reckon'd but 12 Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations; but in St. <hi>Luke</hi> the Generations from <hi>Joſeph</hi> to the ſame <hi>Salathiel</hi> (as is ſuppoſed at leaſt) are no fewer than 21. Nor is there in all this any great Difficulty: Admitting <hi>Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiel</hi> in each place to be one and the ſame
<pb n="XXXVII" facs="tcp:94724:20"/> Perſon: And where ſeveral Lines are drawn from the ſame Head of a Family, there is very often a great difference in the number of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcents. And the Generations from <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Joſeph</hi> may well differ in St. <hi>Matthew</hi> and St. <hi>Luke,</hi> when 'tis remembred that they are reckon'd by <hi>Solomon,</hi> or by his Brother <hi>Nathan.</hi> 'Twou'd be too great a Digreſſion; or elſe 'twere very eaſie to give a very large and clear account of this matter. (2.) It is very unfairly done to inſinuate, that there being but ſo many Generations from <hi>Jacob</hi> to <hi>Obed</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> therefore 'twas not probable there ſhou'd be ſuch a Succeſſion of Kings from <hi>Eſau.</hi> 'Tis true, <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> were of an Age, but he conceals ſomething of moment. They were not ſo when they marry'd: <hi>Eſau</hi> marry'd when he was forty years old, but <hi>Jacob</hi> ſtaid till he was near fourſcore before he marry'd. Here is near 40 years difference, which is of great moment in this matter. This Author, in his Appendix, affirms (I will not anſwer for the Truth of it, nor is this a place to diſpute it) that <hi>Jacob</hi> marry'd <hi>Leah</hi> in the 85th. year of his Age. And for what he knows, <hi>Moſes</hi> might be near 120 years old when he wrote this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Kings of <hi>Edom.</hi> Upon the whole matter, here is ſpace enough for theſe Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. <hi>Joſeph</hi> died when he was 110 years old, and yet he ſaw <hi>Ephraim</hi>'s Children of the <hi>third Generation,</hi> Gen. 50.23, 26.</p>

                     <pb n="XXXVIII" facs="tcp:94724:21"/>3. Though here be ſpace enough for theſe eight Kings, though they were Father and Son, yet we have no Cauſe to believe they were Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Son, but juſt ground to believe they were not. And if they were not, then might the leſs time ſerve for their Succeſſion to one another. We have theſe grounds to believe they were not Father and Son; That, (1.) They are ſaid to be of divers Cities or Places from each other; One of <hi>Dinhabah,</hi> his Succeſſor of <hi>Bozrah;</hi> a Third of the Land of the <hi>Temanites:</hi> 'Tis not very likely that the next Heir ſhou'd live in another City or Country, and at a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move from his Predeceſſor. (2.) 'Tis not ſaid upon the Death of a King that ſuch a one his Son reigned in his ſtead. But when <hi>Bela</hi> died, 'tis ſaid that <hi>Jobah</hi> the Son (not of <hi>Bela,</hi> but) <hi>Zerah</hi> reigned in his ſtead; To him ſucceeded <hi>Huſham,</hi> of the Land of <hi>Temani;</hi> To him <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dad,</hi> the Son of <hi>Bedad;</hi> To him <hi>Samlah</hi> of <hi>Maſrekah;</hi> To him <hi>Saul</hi> of <hi>Rehoboth;</hi> To him <hi>Baal-Hanan,</hi> the Son of <hi>Achbor,</hi> &amp;c. So that the ſucceeding King might, for what this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor knows, be as old or older than his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor; and then a very little ſpace might ſerue for eight Kings to ſucceed each other in; the ſix laſt Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> (where Father was ſucceeded by the Son) took up not above 56 years.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That <hi>Moſes</hi> knew there wou'd be Kings over <hi>Iſrael,</hi> is unqueſtionable from <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. where he delivers Laws concerning that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
<pb n="XXXIX" facs="tcp:94724:21"/> This being one of thoſe three things that were made known to him, but were not to take effect (as <hi>Maimon</hi> well obſerves) till they were in poſſeſſion of the Land of <hi>Canaan. [Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon H. Melach. c.</hi> 1.]</p>
                  <p>The giving up theſe nine Verſes is a thing of moſt dangerous Conſequence. At this rate this Author may give away more of the Holy Writings when he pleaſeth. And then we ſhall be ſure of nothing. For who the Author of them is, he ſays not; nor can the Reader know from our Author whether he were an inſpir'd Author or not. Nor does he give any juſt cauſe why any Man ſhou'd inſert theſe nine Verſes here, had they not been written by <hi>Moſes</hi> from the beginning; I am ſure he can give none.</p>
                  <p>To what hath been ſaid, I add, That <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> himſelf was a King over <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and then the Kings that reigned in <hi>Edom</hi> before <hi>Moſes</hi> was King, may well be ſaid to have reigned before any King over the Children of <hi>Iſrael. Moſes</hi> had the <hi>title</hi> of King: <hi>He was King in Jeſurun,</hi> Deut. 33.5. Nor was it a bare <hi>title,</hi> He was <hi>really</hi> a King, as appears from the <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tateuch.</hi> This is proved at large by Mr. <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, [de Synedriis, l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 1, 2.] This alone is a juſt and full Anſwer to the Objection, which was ſufficiently anſwered before. So far are we from being forced to part with nine Verſes at once, that we are under no difficulty at all. 'Tis plain that when <hi>Moſes</hi> came out
<pb n="XL" facs="tcp:94724:22"/> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> that <hi>Edom</hi> was under Dukes, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.15. Theſe cou'd not be the firſt <hi>ſett</hi> of Dukes, mention'd <hi>Gen.</hi> 36.29, 30. For they were <hi>Horites;</hi> and if they were the <hi>ſecond ſett, v.</hi> 40.—then were the eight Kings dead before <hi>Moſes</hi> was King in <hi>Jeſurun.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After all; theſe eight Kings might be <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites</hi> (called <hi>Horim,</hi> Deut. 2.12.) whom the Children of <hi>Eſau</hi> diſpoſſeſſed and ſucceeded, for any thing that appears. They are ſaid to <hi>have reigned in the land of Edom</hi> (and ſo the <hi>Horite's</hi> Land was when <hi>Moſes</hi> wrote theſe words) but not to be deſcended or come from <hi>Eſau,</hi> as is expreſsly ſaid of the following Dukes, <hi>v.</hi> 40. This account agrees with the Context. We have an account juſt before of the <hi>Dukes</hi> of the <hi>Horites,</hi> the <hi>Children of Seir in the land of Edom,</hi> v. 21. Though theſe are ſaid to have been <hi>Dukes</hi> in the Land of <hi>Edom,</hi> yet they were not deſcended from <hi>Eſau,</hi> but from <hi>Hori,</hi> in the Land of <hi>Seir,</hi> v. 30. And then there's no ground to believe the eight Kings were deſcended from <hi>Eſau,</hi> becauſe they are ſaid to <hi>have reigned in the land of Edom,</hi> ſince the Dukes <hi>in the land of Edom were Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites,</hi> and did not come from <hi>Eſau.</hi> Beſides, the 4th. of theſe eight Kings is ſaid to have ſmitten <hi>Midian</hi> in the Field of <hi>Moab,</hi> v. 35. If by <hi>Midian</hi> be meant the perſon ſo called, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.2. then there can be no doubt of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For then theſe eight Kings cou'd not be the Poſterity of <hi>Eſau,</hi> but <hi>Horites</hi> they might
<pb n="XLI" facs="tcp:94724:22"/> be, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 14.6.) and then they had finiſhed their Reigns before <hi>Moſes</hi> was King in <hi>Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run.</hi>

And though it were of old time call'd <hi>Kirjath-Arba,</hi> yet even in the time of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and after the Remark, <hi>chap.</hi> 14.15. <hi>Hebron</hi> it is call'd, as by the name it was moſt commonly known by.

Again, <hi>Kirjath-Arba,</hi> which is <hi>Hebron,</hi> v. 54.

                  <p n="2">2.

It is pretended that <hi>Moſes</hi> cou'd not write thoſe words, <hi>Deut.</hi> 2.12. <hi>The Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rims alſo dwelt in Seir before-time, but the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Eſau ſucceeded them, when they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their ſtead; as Iſrael did unto the land of his poſſeſſion, which the Lord gave unto them.</hi> The force of the Objection lies in the latter part of the words, <hi>as Iſrael did,</hi> &amp;c. By which it's pretended is meant, that <hi>Iſrael</hi> dwelt in <hi>Seir,</hi> and expell'd the <hi>Idumaeans,</hi> but that this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not in the time of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as appears from <hi>v.</hi> 5. but long afterwards.

<pb n="XLIV" facs="tcp:94724:24"/> any ſhadow of ground from this Text. And for the true meaning of the place, I referr the Reader to the Note on <hi>Deut.</hi> 2.12.</p>

                     <hi>Obj.</hi> V. It is pretended that <hi>Moſes</hi> could not write thoſe words, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.6. <hi>And the Canaanite was then in the Land.</hi> This Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is made by Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> and by <hi>Spinoſa.</hi> The utmoſt of it amounts but to thus much, That theſe words cou'd not be writ by <hi>Moſes,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it wou'd be <hi>impertinent</hi> for him to ſay this which was ſo <hi>well known</hi> at that time. For the <hi>Canaanite</hi> continu'd above 400 years in the Land after this, and therefore thoſe words were added by ſome hand after the Deſtruction of the <hi>Canaanites.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Before I anſwer this, I obſerve this by the way, That this Objection is not of the ſort of ſome others, which pretend, that <hi>Moſes</hi> cou'd not write ſome paſſages, becauſe the words they inſiſt on mention ſome-thing that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned after his time. That cannot be pretended here. Here all that can be ſaid, is, That <hi>we</hi> cannot think <hi>Moſes</hi> wou'd write theſe words without a Cauſe.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, 1. That what <hi>Moſes</hi> ſays is, that the <hi>Canaanite</hi> was THEN <hi>in the Land:</hi> i. e. He had in thoſe early days of <hi>Abram</hi> poſſeſſion of that Land which God intended above 400 years afterward to beſtow on the Poſterity of <hi>Abram.</hi> In the very next words we read, <hi>And the Lord appear'd unto Abram, and ſaid unto thy
<pb n="XLV" facs="tcp:94724:24"/> ſeed, Will I give</hi> THIS <hi>Land:</hi> i. e. This very Land which is now in poſſeſſion of the <hi>Canaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,</hi> and for that reaſon call'd the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> chap. 11.31. We have a particular account of the Deſtruction of the <hi>Canaanite,</hi> and of the preciſe time when it hapned: But that Relation does not tell us how long they had been poſſeſſed of it. That we learn here. The Objectors force a ſenſe upon the words. As if theſe words, <hi>The Canaanite was then in the Land,</hi> imported thus much, <hi>The Canaanite was not as yet diſpoſſeſs'd of the Land.</hi> Whereas the Text onely tells us that they were Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of it THEN, when <hi>Abram</hi> came firſt to it, and when God promis'd it to his Poſterity. And then the words have no reference to the Deſtruction of the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> but to their early Poſſeſſion onely.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is very certain that the word <hi>Canaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite</hi> ſometimes ſignifies a particular Tribe or Family ſo call'd, and not the general Name of the Inhabitants of that Land: Thus the word ſignifies, <hi>Gen.</hi> 13.7.15.21. <hi>Numb.</hi> 13.29.14.25. And then <hi>Moſes</hi> onely relates that in that tract of Land in which <hi>Abram</hi> then was, this Tribe dwelt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is very unreaſonable therefore to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject this againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> his being the Author of theſe words; and that, becauſe we do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the reaſon of his bringing in theſe words in this place. Becauſe there might be ſufficient Reaſons, though at this diſtance we
<pb n="XLVI" facs="tcp:94724:25"/> were not able to diſcern them: And at this rate we may reject any ancient Author whatſoever. I add, that 'tis to be conſidered what Land is meant in theſe words. 'Tis ſaid that <hi>Abram paſſed through the Land to the place of Sichem:</hi> It follows, <hi>The Canaanite was then in the Land,</hi> [viz. <hi>of Sichem.</hi>] But theſe <hi>Canaanites</hi> were deſtroyed, and their City ſpoiled, and their Land driven, before the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> went into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

To which I anſwer,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, As to <hi>v.</hi> 11. For the mention of the Bed-ſtead, <hi>Moſes</hi> cannot be charged with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinence: He mentions it <hi>ad fidem faciendam;</hi> and he wrote for Poſterity, and not barely for thoſe who were then living: Beſides, there might alſo be very many of them who never ſaw the Giant; and to ſuppoſe it ſhou'd have been in <hi>Baſhan,</hi> proves nothing at all: To af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that this Bed-ſtead was not found till <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s time, and to cite to that purpoſe, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.30. is to abuſe the Reader, for there's no ſuch thing to be found there.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The Objection is in it ſelf very unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Theſe Objectors have ſome pretence when they urge againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> that he wrote of things after his time. But ſhall he be blam'd alſo when he writes of things that hapned in his own time?

                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="L" facs="tcp:94724:27"/>1. 'Tis manifeſt that this Commentator on <hi>Geneſis</hi> trifles, when he lays a ſtreſs upon the Preterperfect tenſe, by which the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Manna</hi> is expreſs'd. He cannot but know that 'tis an Obſervation of no weight in this matter. Nothing is more common among the Sacred Writers than ſuch an <hi>Enallage</hi> of Tenſe. And it muſt be allow'd, eſpecially in the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Prophets, who ſpeak of Things cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to come to paſs, as of Things already paſt. This very word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is by our Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters elſewhere rendred by a <hi>future: All they that are fat upon Earth ſhall eat and worſhip,</hi> Pſ. 22.29. And that rendring of the word may be defended very eaſily: It not onely <hi>may</hi> be ſo rendred, but in that place it <hi>ought</hi> ſo to be, as is evident to him that conſiders the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text. Again, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.21. we have the ſame word, and it hath there the ſignification of a future, as appears from the Context. To which I may add, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 4.10. and <hi>Zechar.</hi> 12.6. in which places this very word occurrs, and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies as a future. See alſo <hi>Gen.</hi> 45.18. where this word is rendred, <hi>Ye ſhall eat.</hi> And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever 'tis rendred here, or ought to be render'd; yet certain it is, that Author ought not to have inſiſted on that which is ſo very frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Suppoſing <hi>Moſes</hi> to have written theſe words, yet here is no juſt Charge or Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can be brought againſt him. Will any Man ſay that he wrote that which is not true?
<pb n="LI" facs="tcp:94724:27"/> That no Man hath attempted to do. 'Tis granted on all hands, that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did eat <hi>Manna</hi> ſo long as is affirm'd here. Will they ſay that he wrote a thing that was not known to him to be a Truth? That they will not ſay. For 'tis allow'd that the thing was made known to him, that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſhou'd eat <hi>Manna</hi> ſo long. And if theſe Men ſhou'd have been ſo hardy as to deny this, yet it might eaſily be prov'd. What is it then that forbids <hi>Moſes</hi> to be the Author of theſe words? If it be this that he writes for forty years, when he dy'd at leaſt ſome months before that time was expir'd.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I anſwer, That this is no Objection againſt him: Becauſe there is nothing more common with the Sacred Writers, than to give the full number to that which, ſtrictly ſpeaking, is not complete. The <hi>Jews</hi> have a Rule in this caſe not to be rejected; <gap reason="foreign">

And <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf uſeth this way of ſpeaking. After the Spies return'd, he does, by God's direction, tell the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that their Children ſhou'd wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the Wilderneſs forty years, though 'tis a thing confeſs'd that they did not after that wander above 38, or 39 years; <hi>vid.</hi> Numb. 14.33. Yet <hi>Moſes,</hi> when he ſpeaks of it, calls it <hi>forty.</hi> Compare <hi>Numb.</hi> 32.13. with <hi>Deut.</hi> 2.14. and <hi>Joſh.</hi> 5.6. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95.10. If it be ſtill urged that <hi>Moſes</hi> affirms, that <hi>they did eat
<pb n="LII" facs="tcp:94724:28"/> till they came into the Land.</hi> I anſwer, That he might well do ſo. For the Event was well-nigh paſt when <hi>Moſes</hi> liv'd, and for what we know when he wrote theſe words: And the thing he ſpeaks of being upon the matter al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready paſſed, 'tis no wonder that he does not uſe a <hi>Future</hi> Tenſe, but the <hi>Preterperfect.</hi>
                  </p>

Admitting this Tranſlation (which cannot reaſonably be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed) the whole force of the Objection falls at once. The Author above-named was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no neceſſity of parting with this place; He was too forward to part with his Divine Author, when he was content to drop him

                     <hi>Obj.</hi> VIII. We read <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.14. <hi>And Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham call'd the name of that place Jehovah-jireh: as it is to this day, in the mount of the Lord it ſhall be ſeen.</hi> Theſe are ſuppoſed not to be the words of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but of a later Writer. It is pretended that this place was Mount <hi>Moriah,</hi> in which the Temple was afterwards built, and that it was not call'd ſo before ſuch time as the Temple was built; and therefore this cou'd not be written till that time, which was long after the Time of <hi>Moſes.</hi> It is farther preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that it is not likely that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhou'd write thoſe words, <hi>In the Mount of the Lord it ſhall be ſeen,</hi> becauſe the Writer of thoſe words affirms that That proverbial Speech was uſed in his Time. To which I anſwer,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I am not concern'd whether this were the very place that was afterwards call'd <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riah</hi> or not. 'Tis enough to my purpoſe that it is not call'd <hi>Moriah</hi> even in this place. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever affinity Men may fanſie between <hi>Jehovah-jireh</hi> and <hi>Moriah,</hi> 'tis certain they are not one
<pb n="LIV" facs="tcp:94724:29"/> and the ſame Name. Here's nothing proved, and we are not obliged to regard groundleſs Imaginations; and that is all we have here offer'd to us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Nor is there any thing in the following words, but what is very agreeable to the Time and Age of <hi>Moſes.</hi> For why might not this proverbial Speech be in uſe from the Days of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to the Time of <hi>Moſes?</hi> Here is ſpace enough from the Time of <hi>Abraham</hi> to that of <hi>Moſes,</hi> for ſuch a Saying to become a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Saying, or proverbial Speech. If a later Writer might ſay, <hi>As it is ſaid to this day,</hi> why might not <hi>Moſes</hi> ſay it as well? I confeſs ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely I do not ſee in this Objection any thing that hath the leaſt appearance of weight in it: And ſhou'd have been aſham'd to mention it, were it not incumbent upon me in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to lay the Objections I meet with fairly before the Reader.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> IX. The Author of the <hi>Leviathan</hi> roundly affirms that <hi>Moſes</hi> cou'd not be the Author of thoſe words, <hi>Numb.</hi> 21.14. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is ſaid in the book of the Wars of the Lord, what be did in the Red-ſea, and in the Brooks of Arnon.</hi> But he offers no reaſon for this Opinion of his, and therefore I do not think my ſelf obliged to take any farther no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of him in this matter. However, I find that <hi>Spinoſa</hi> offers ſomething like a Reaſon for this Opinion; and, as near as I can gueſs,
<pb n="LV" facs="tcp:94724:29"/> here lies the Argument: That <hi>Moſes</hi> wrote a Book of the War againſt <hi>Amalek</hi> by God's Command, he ſays is evident from <hi>Exod.</hi> 17.14. But it does not from that place appear in what Book he wrote it. But in <hi>Numb.</hi> 21. (he adds) a Book is cited, call'd <hi>The Book of the Wars of the Lord;</hi> and in this Book, ſays he, without doubt the War againſt <hi>Amalek,</hi> and the ſeveral Journeys of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> (which were written by <hi>Moſes,</hi> as we find 'tis ſaid <hi>Numb.</hi> 33.2.) are related. Hence he ſeems to inſinuate, that the <hi>Pentateuch</hi> was not written by <hi>Moſes,</hi> but by ſome other hand, who cites the Writings of <hi>Moſes;</hi> And that therefore the <hi>Pentateuch</hi> was on this account rather written <hi>of Moſes,</hi> than <hi>by</hi> Him. This is the moſt that I can make of the Pretence of this obſcure Writer; and after all, I can ſee very little that needs an Anſwer.</p>
                  <p>The Place, I grant, is obſcure and difficult; but that does not prove it was not written by <hi>Moſes.</hi> The Place is conſider'd in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Notes, to which I referr the Reader. However, having this Occaſion offer'd me, that I may not ſeem to neglect any thing for the farther ſatisfaction of the Reader, I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to explain the Matter related in <hi>Numb.</hi> 21. and then ſhew how vain this Pretence is.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, As to the Matter related, thus it is: The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had receiv'd a Command not to diſtreſs or diſturb the <hi>Ammonites</hi> or <hi>Moabites</hi> in their Poſſeſſions, God declaring that he
<pb n="LVI" facs="tcp:94724:30"/> wou'd not beſtow their Land upon them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 2. It is the buſineſs of <hi>Moſes</hi> to ſhew that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had not broken that Law. It is true it might be pretended (and was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended afterwards in the days of <hi>Jephthah</hi>) that they had broken it: Becauſe upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of <hi>Sihon</hi> and <hi>Og,</hi> 'tis certain that the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> had taken poſſeſſion of thoſe Lands which ſometime belong'd to this People, whom they were forbid to diſturb. But 'tis to be conſider'd, that theſe Lands were at that time in the poſſeſſion of the <hi>Amorites,</hi> who had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed the <hi>Ammonites</hi> and <hi>Moabites.</hi> I will not ſo far make a digreſſion, as to ſhew who were the Poſſeſſors of theſe Lands from the Time of <hi>Abraham.</hi> I ſhall content my ſelf in ſhewing the deſign of <hi>Moſes</hi> in this relation: And that was, (1.) To ſhew when the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> came to the River <hi>Arnon,</hi> they found it to be the Boundary or Border between <hi>Moab</hi> and the <hi>Amorites.</hi> This he affirms <hi>v.</hi> 13. and confirms it out of a known Book in thoſe Times, call'd <hi>The Book of the Wars of the Lord,</hi> v. 14. (2.) To prove that the Country which the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> took from <hi>Sihon,</hi> and which did formerly belong to the <hi>Moabites,</hi> was quite loſt from the <hi>Moabites</hi> in the time of a former King before <hi>Balak.</hi> This is affirmed <hi>v.</hi> 26. And therefore <hi>Iſrael</hi> found <hi>Sihon</hi> in full poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of this Country. This he alſo proves from ſome known and acknowledged Sayings at that time, that ſerv'd to preſerve the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
<pb n="LVII" facs="tcp:94724:30"/> of the fact. Whether it were in ſome Song, or contain'd in ſome Commentary of Facts that were paſſed, I enquire not, <hi>v.</hi> 27, 28, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The words ſeem to imply that the victorious <hi>Amorites</hi> did expreſs their Triumph on the ſcore of their Victory over the <hi>Moa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites</hi> in thoſe terms which the Text lays before us.</p>
                  <p>This account of the deſign of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and his way of gaining that deſign, will eaſily give the Reader to underſtand that theſe words muſt needs be obſcure and difficult, becauſe we are not acquainted with the perfect Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of thoſe Times, nor with the Memorials of Facts that then had hapned.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I proceed to ſhew the great Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the foregoing Pretence. I might very well premiſe that the Proofs that <hi>Moſes</hi> wrote not theſe Books, had need be very clear, or elſe we are guilty of great Vanity in admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them: And this is far from that, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of the moſt difficult and obſcure Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of the whole <hi>Pentateuch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſtill here is nothing proved. That <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> wrote this Book, called, <hi>The Wars of the Lord,</hi> appears not; And granting it to be true, it is nothing to the purpoſe. For why might not <hi>Moſes</hi> cite a Book of his own Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, as well as another and later Author? And what if <hi>Moſes</hi> did write the Wars of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malek,</hi> muſt he therefore write that of the <hi>Amorites</hi> Warring againſt the <hi>Moabites,</hi> before
<pb n="LVIII" facs="tcp:94724:31"/> he was concerned with them, alſo? Theſe kind of pretences may amuſe ſome that are not given to Thinking, they can never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with them that conſider duly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> X. 'Tis pretended that the <hi>Pentateuch</hi> was not written <hi>by Moſes,</hi> but rather <hi>of</hi> him: And that, becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> is generally mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Writer as a third Perſon: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that, we find <hi>Moſes</hi> is commended in the Pentateuch, (<hi>Numb.</hi> 12.6, 8. <hi>Deut.</hi> 34.10.) And if we take him for the Writer of thoſe Books, we muſt ſuppoſe him alſo to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended himſelf, which will hardly be granted in a Man of ſo great Humility and Wiſdom as <hi>Moſes</hi> was. I anſwer,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As to the Pretence that <hi>Moſes</hi> is not the Author, becauſe he ſpeaks of himſelf as of a third Perſon; then it follows, That whoever does in his Hiſtory or Work m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ntion himſelf, (as <hi>Moſes</hi> in theſe Books is ſuppoſed to do) he cannot be the Author of that Book or Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: This wou'd be to conclude too much. And yet if this Propoſition be not true, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap> Objection hath, ſo far as it goes, no manner of force in it. That he cannot be the Author of a Book that mentions himſelf as a third Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, may be affirm'd indeed eaſily, but can never be proved. If this were admitted, we muſt diſcharge ſeveral Authors of the Books of the Holy Scriptures both of the Old and New Teſtament alſo; and then we muſt not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="LIX" facs="tcp:94724:31"/> that <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> wrote the Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries that go under his name, or <hi>Joſephus</hi> that part of his reputed Works, where he ſpeaks of himſelf as of a Third Perſon. 'Tis hardly cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible that the Objectors can believe the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of this Objection, and I think there is no fear (if they ſhould) that any indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Perſon ſhou'd believe with them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As to the ſecond Part of the Objection: That we cannot ſuppoſe that <hi>Moſes</hi> wou'd commend himſelf, nor conſequently that he ſhou'd write the <hi>Pentateuch</hi> where he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended. I anſwer, That this Objection, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may be inferr'd from it, does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that <hi>Moſes</hi> was not the Author of theſe Books. For 'tis not impoſſible for a Man to write an <hi>Encomium</hi> of himſelf. But let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Matter more cloſely.</p>
                  <p>'Tis ſaid indeed that the <hi>Man Moſes was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry meek above all the Men which were upon the face of the Earth,</hi> Numb. 12.3. This is ſaid upon occaſion of what was ſaid againſt him by <hi>Miriam</hi> and <hi>Aaron.</hi> They ſpake againſt him very ſharply: Upon which 'tis ſaid, <hi>And the Lord heard</hi> it. <hi>Moſes</hi> is not ſaid to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it himſelf: He was not like to give any juſt offence, nor apt to fall into anger when others reproach'd him. It follows, <hi>Now the man Moſes was very meek,</hi> &amp;c. I do not ſee what there is in theſe words unbecoming <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:</hi> Here's no boaſting or pride; no ſhadow or foot-ſteps of it. He had a juſt occaſion to
<pb n="LX" facs="tcp:94724:32"/> mention, that he had neither <hi>provoked</hi> theſe angry <hi>perſons,</hi> nor did he <hi>highly</hi> reſent the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches</hi> they followed him with. He might ſay this well enough, and aſcribe due honour to God, who had wrought this Temper in him. The beſt Man in the World may well be allowed to defend his own Innocence, and to own the great Things which God hath done for him. The Objection will lie againſt <hi>Job,</hi> againſt the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> againſt St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as well as againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> if a good Man may not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, upon any occaſion, ſpeak well of himſelf.</p>
                  <p>For what follows in <hi>v.</hi> 6, 7, 8. where <hi>Moſes</hi> is preferr'd to any other Prophet, 'tis certain that they are the Words not of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but of God himſelf. And well might he write what God himſelf ſaid upon this occaſion, eſpecially when it tended ſo much to juſtifie his Divine Miſſion, upon the credit whereof the ſucceſs of all his Miniſtry intirely depended.</p>
                  <p>The Sin of <hi>Moſes</hi> is related (<hi>Numb.</hi> 20.12.) and the Puniſhment inflicted on him on that account. The relating of this is as ſtrong an Objection againſt another Perſon's writing theſe Books, as what is nam'd above is againſt <hi>Moſes.</hi> For, ſuppoſing another Perſon had been the Writer, that Writer muſt be ſuppos'd not onely to relate what we read (<hi>Numb.</hi> 20.) but to repeat it frequently alſo.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> XI. It is pretended that <hi>Moſes</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſuppoſed to be the Author of thoſe
<pb n="LXI" facs="tcp:94724:32"/> words, <hi>Exod.</hi> 6. <hi>Theſe are that Aaron and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to whom the Lord ſaid, Bring out the children of Iſrael from the land of Egypt according to their armies. Theſe are they which ſpake to Pharaoh King of Egypt, to bring out the children of Iſrael from Egypt. Theſe are that Moſes and Aaron,</hi> v. 26, 27. 'Tis ſuppos'd that <hi>Moſes</hi> wou'd not write thus of himſelf. I anſwer,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That he may well be ſuppos'd to write as a Third Perſon, as hath been ſhewed before: And then,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Allowing him to write for the ſake of Poſterity, and not onely for the Perſons of that preſent Age (of which there can be no doubt) He may well be granted to be the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of theſe words, concerning himſelf and <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> who were both greatly concerned in the Matters related afterwards.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> XII. The Author of the Book call'd <hi>Tractatus Theologico politicus</hi> mentions ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Books written by <hi>Moſes;</hi> and wou'd thence inferr (by a way of reaſoning peculiar to himſelf) that <hi>Moſes</hi> was not the Author of the <hi>Pentateuch:</hi> He mentions the <hi>Book</hi> of the <hi>Covenant</hi> (Exod. 24.) This Book, he ſays, contains very little; <hi>viz.</hi> Thoſe Precepts one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly which are found from <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.24. to <hi>chap.</hi> 24. And he allows that <hi>Moſes</hi> wrote the <hi>Book</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> Deut. 31.9. which <hi>Joſhua</hi> afterwards enlarged; <hi>viz.</hi> with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Covenant which the People enter'd

He grants that <hi>Moſes</hi> wrote a <hi>Book</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> and gave it to the Prieſts, with a Command that it ſhou'd be at a certain time read unto the People, which cou'd not therefore be the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too great a Volume to be read at one So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity.

And this <hi>Book</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> containing part of the <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> and this <hi>Song</hi> is all that he will allow him to have written and left to Poſterity. I anſwer,</p>

It does not follow from thence, that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> did not write the whole <hi>Pentateuch.</hi> When 'tis agreed that he wrote and deliver'd ſome parts of it; does it thence follow he did not write the whole? I ſhou'd have been much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham'd to have troubled the Reader with this paſſage of the Author above-written, becauſe there is nothing worthy of the Reader's notice; no Argument, nor appearance of any: But I think my ſelf oblig'd fairly to repreſent what the Objector's <hi>ſay</hi> in this matter, though they <hi>prove</hi> nothing.</p>

To which I anſwer,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Writer of this paſſage does onely report the words of <hi>Joſeph;</hi> ſo that the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction bears as hard againſt a later Writer, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Moſes:</hi> For who-ever the Writer be, 'tis not the Writer that calls it the Land of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews;</hi> he brings in <hi>Joſeph,</hi> calling it ſo. If <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> did not call it ſo, the <hi>Relater</hi> or Writer hath not told us Truth; and then the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on bears againſt any Writer, be it <hi>Moſes</hi> or ſome other perſon; and then, in truth, it is an Objection againſt the Book it ſelf, as not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of belief. If <hi>Joſeph</hi> did call it the Land of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> why might not <hi>Moſes</hi> be the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as well as a later Author? He was rather better able to report the Matter a-right, than a later Writer, as he liv'd nearer to that time when the words were ſpoken.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

                  <p n="1">1. That here being nothing but the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor's Suppoſition, this Objection needs no An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; for 'tis not reaſonable that mere Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions ſhou'd be regarded without any ſhadow of proof.</p>

<pb n="LXV" facs="tcp:94724:34"/> (who is a more competent Judge than any later Objector) affirms that the Tower of <hi>Edar</hi> was the place of the Shepherds near to <hi>Bethle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem,</hi> (where the Company of Angels declar'd the Nativity of our Saviour) and that it was the place where <hi>Joſeph</hi> fed his Flock, and where the Shepherds that watched by night at the time of our Saviour's Birth (<hi>Luke</hi> 2.) heard the heavenly Hoſt, ſaying, <hi>Glory be to God in the higheſt, and on Earth peace, good-will towards Men.</hi> [Hieron. quaeſt. in Geneſ.

And this they attempt to prove from 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9.9. where 'tis ſaid, <hi>Before-time in Iſrael, when a man went to enquire of God, thus he ſpake, Come, and let us go to the Seer: for he that is now called a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, was before-time called a Seer.</hi> To which I anſwer,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That if this be any Objection againſt <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> then may we with as good Reaſon object this, where-ever we find the word we here ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Prophet</hi> in the <hi>Pentateuch.</hi> We find this word in ſeveral places, and ſhall we therefore conclude that <hi>Moſes</hi> wrote none of thoſe places? If it has any force here, it has the ſame every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where elſe. And yet Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> allows that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> did write the Book of <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> from <hi>chap. XI.</hi> to the end of <hi>chap. XXVII.</hi> and yet in that part of <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> we find this word (which we render <hi>Prophet</hi>) ſeveral times. <hi>E. g. If there ariſe among you a Prophet,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And thou ſhalt not hearken to the words of that Prophet,</hi> Deut. 13.1, 3. Again, <hi>The Lord thy God will raiſe up unto thee a Prophet,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I will raiſe them a Prophet:</hi> And <hi>the Prophet which ſhall preſume,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>when a Prophet ſpeaketh in the Name of the Lord,</hi> Deut. 18.15, 18, 20, 22. Beſides, the word is uſed elſewhere, as <hi>Exod.</hi> 7.1. <hi>Numb.</hi> 12.6. and <hi>chap.</hi> 11.29. and <hi>Deut.</hi>
                     <pb n="LXVII" facs="tcp:94724:35"/> 34.10. Will any believe this word was not uſed in the time of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or that if he wrote theſe places, yet he wrote <hi>Seer,</hi> and the word <hi>Prophet</hi> was added by a later Hand?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Some of theſe words are quoted in the New Teſtament, and there the word <hi>Prophet</hi> is retain'd, and not the word <hi>Seer.</hi> And they are quoted in ſuch terms alſo, as may put this matter out of diſpute, and ſatisfie us that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> wrote the words quoted, and that the word <hi>Prophet</hi> was known in his time. Let us hear how St. <hi>Peter</hi> quotes theſe words from <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.18. For <hi>Moſes truly ſaid unto your Fathers, A Prophet ſhall the Lord your God raiſe up unto you.</hi> He tells us that 'twas <hi>Moſes</hi> (and not a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Writer) that ſaid this; he expreſſeth it (not by <hi>Seer,</hi> but) by the word <hi>Prophet.</hi> St. <hi>Stephen</hi> cites the ſame paſſage, and after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. <hi>This is that which Moſes ſaid unto the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael, A Prophet ſhall the Lord your God raiſe unto you,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Act.</hi> 3.22. and <hi>chap.</hi> 7.37. Nothing can be plainer, nothing more convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing than theſe words are, both that <hi>Moſes</hi> wrote theſe <hi>words,</hi> and that the word render'd <hi>Prophet</hi> was uſed in his time.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I ſhall conſider the words in the Book of <hi>Samuel,</hi> and ſhew that they will not ſerve the purpoſe to which they are produced. The words are theſe: <hi>Before-time in Iſrael, when a man went to enquire of God, thus he ſpake, Come, and let us go to the Seer: for he that is now called a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, was before-time called a Seer.</hi> Does this
<pb n="LXVIII" facs="tcp:94724:36"/> Writer ſay, That the word we render <hi>Prophet,</hi> was not known in the time of <hi>Moſes?</hi> He ſays no ſuch thing. Does he ſay, That the word we render <hi>Prophet</hi> was not known till that Age? He ſays it not. All that he affirms is this, That before that time the perſon called a <hi>Prophet</hi> was called a <hi>Seer.</hi> This we grant readily: He was called a <hi>Seer</hi> before; but this does not inferr that he was not called a <hi>Prophet</hi> alſo, even then when he was called a <hi>Seer.</hi> The moſt that can be concluded from the place is this, That for ſome-time before, he that was called a <hi>Prophet</hi> then, was commonly called a <hi>Seer:</hi> And then there is no more than this to be inferred; That how old ſoever the word <hi>Prophet</hi> had been, yet for ſome-time before that paſſage was rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it was very common to call him a <hi>Seer.</hi> It ſeems the word <hi>Prophet</hi> was at that time when this is related, in common uſe; and yet after theſe words, the word <hi>Seer</hi> is uſed, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9.11. And ſo it was in the days of <hi>Micah,</hi> when the word <hi>Prophet</hi> was in common and ordinary uſe, <hi>Micah</hi> 3.7. And as the word <hi>Seer</hi> was uſed when <hi>Prophet</hi> was uſed moſt commonly, ſo have we good Reaſon to believe that the word <hi>Prophet</hi> was alſo uſed, when <hi>Seer</hi> was a word in common and ordinary uſe. And 'tis appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently evident from what hath been ſaid above, that the word was as old as <hi>Moſes.</hi>

'Tis pretended that theſe words cou'd not be written by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> when theſe Meaſures were in uſe and well known, but by a much later hand after the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſion of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> among other Nations; among whom they had been uſed to other Meaſures, that the Reader might the better underſtand the Meaſure here mentioned. To which I anſwer,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That it does not appear that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did ever alter their Meaſures whilſt they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in the Poſſeſſion of the Land of <hi>Canaan:</hi> And if they did not, there cou'd be no reaſon aſſign'd why we ſhou'd ſuppoſe any thing added here by way of Explication by a later hand.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Nor can we reaſonably ſuppoſe ſuch an Explication cou'd ſignifie any thing in this caſe. For how cou'd any Man be the wiſer for it? For how ſhou'd an <hi>Ephah</hi> be better known than an <hi>Omer?</hi> This wou'd be no Explication in After-times, when the Meaſures uſed of old were once forgotten. And why may not an <hi>Ephah</hi> be as well forgot as an <hi>Omer?</hi> And if it were, the Reader cou'd gain nothing at all by ſuch words as theſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And therefore 'tis much more reaſonable to believe that theſe words were here from the beginning, when an <hi>Ephah</hi> was in uſe common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and that ſo it was in the days of <hi>Moſes.</hi>

<pb n="LXX" facs="tcp:94724:37"/> great force in them, I will here put together, and anſwer: <hi>viz.</hi> Gen. 2.11, 12. <hi>The name of the firſt is Piſon, that</hi> is <hi>it which compaſſeth the whole land of Havilah, where</hi> there is <hi>gold: and the gold of that land</hi> is <hi>good: there</hi> is <hi>Bdellium, and the Onyx-ſtone.</hi> 'Tis pretended that theſe are the words of one who lived in <hi>Chaldaea,</hi> where 'tis ſuppos'd that <hi>Piſon</hi> was; and that Geography was not well enough known to <hi>Moſes</hi> to relate ſuch Particulars. Again, 'Tis pretended that the account we have of <hi>Nimrod</hi> and his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, <hi>chap.</hi> 10.8. is more than <hi>Moſes</hi> can be ſuppoſed to give; and that That account wou'd have been more uſefull after the <hi>Jews</hi> had been better acquainted with <hi>Babylon.</hi> And Laſtly, The account we have of <hi>Niniveh,</hi> which is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to have been Founded after the Time of <hi>Moſes,</hi> is therefore ſuppoſed to be none of his. To which I anſwer,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As to <hi>Piſon,</hi> not to examine the Situation of it, (which, for what appears, might not be ſo diſtant from <hi>Moſes</hi> as <hi>Chaldaea</hi>) the Objector hath no reaſon to object hence againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> becauſe he does not know how far <hi>Moſes</hi> did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand Geography; nor hath he any cauſe to ſay the places mention'd did not trade and traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick into <hi>Egypt,</hi> where <hi>Moſes</hi> was born, <hi>Gen.</hi> 37.25.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As to the account of <hi>Nimrod</hi> and his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, we have no ſhadow of reaſon to ſuſpect it. For <hi>Babylon,</hi> and ſome other places mention'd on this occaſion, were afterwards ſo famous in ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that 'tis not to be wonder'd at that <hi>Moſes</hi>
                     <pb n="LXXI" facs="tcp:94724:37"/> ſhou'd give an account of this <hi>perſon,</hi> who was ſo very remarkable in his Time, and of theſe Places that were ſo famous afterwards: Nor cou'd any thing be done more properly than in that very place, where <hi>Moſes</hi> gives an account of the Families deriv'd from the Sons of <hi>Noah,</hi> which Peopl'd the ſeveral parts of the Earth.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For the Name of <hi>Niniveh,</hi> which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be later than the Times of <hi>Moſes,</hi> I need ſay no more than this, That this is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed onely; but I never yet (to my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance) ſaw any kind of proof of it, or any thing that looks that way. And cou'd I ſee any thing like a proof, I ſhou'd think my ſelf oblig'd to give an anſwer to it: But I cannot be obliged to follow mere Suppoſitions, and wander after the Fanſies and vain Imaginations of Scriblers.</p>

                  <p>I anſwer: That this looks like an Objection, and deſerves to be accounted for.

                  <p n="2">2. That it does not thence follow that <hi>Moſes</hi>
                     <pb n="LXXIII" facs="tcp:94724:38"/> was not the Author. 'Tis ſtrange that any Man who profeſſeth Chriſtianity ſhou'd argue at this rate.

                  <p n="3">3. As 'tis far from being an Argument that <hi>Moſes</hi> was not the Author of theſe Books, ſo the thing it ſelf is of a very trifling Conſideration.

And if it cou'd be prov'd, that what is related of that matter, <hi>Exod.</hi> 18. did not come to paſs till after the Law was given; yet will this be no Objection againſt <hi>Moſes;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that might notwithſtanding be the fitteſt place to relate <hi>Jethro</hi>'s Journey, <hi>Moſes</hi> being juſt entring upon the account of the giving the Law, and then of the particular Laws that were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>&amp;c. Moſes</hi> does not date the Coming of <hi>Jethro;</hi> and for what appears, 'tis related in the fitteſt place. For <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Journey with <hi>Sarah</hi> to <hi>Gerar,</hi> we are not concern'd to know the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe time of it, nor does <hi>Moſes</hi> give it us, and we have no cauſe to find fault with his placing the Relation where we find it; We are very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable in this matter. The Hiſtorian was beſt Judge where to relate the ſeveral Facts he
<pb n="LXXIV" facs="tcp:94724:39"/> had to mention. And we do not, when we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject this, allow him the liberty that all other Hiſtorians are allow'd; <hi>viz.</hi> To make their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations in ſuch places as they judge moſt conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient. And it is to me a very evident proof, that thoſe Men have very little to ſay againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> who will lay hold on ſuch impertinent trifles as theſe are. Theſe are mere Cavils, and ſpeak a bad Temper.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Nor is there much of this to pretend. <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> indeed did not write his Hiſtory by way of <hi>Annals,</hi> nor his Laws in the exact method and form of <hi>Juſtinian</hi>'s Inſtitutions. But this is no Objection againſt the Author of the Books, or the Books themſelves. As there is not that <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,</hi> ſo there is not that <hi>confuſion</hi> which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. The Objector needed not to have ſaid that there are in the Pentateuch, <hi>Tam multa con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſa, inordinata, extra locum &amp; ſeriem poſita.</hi> For there is no great matter of this kind to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected after all this noiſe. For the Inſtances he gives of <hi>Jethro</hi>'s Journey, and <hi>Abraham</hi>'s going to <hi>Gerar,</hi> they are not worth his while: For, in truth, they do not ſerve his purpoſe; And though he inſtance in the <hi>Journey</hi> of <hi>Iſaac</hi> to <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rar,</hi> that will do his Cauſe no good; I appeal to any indifferent Reader. The Objector ſhou'd have laid theſe things before the Reader, and ſhewed how they tend to his great End. For here's nothing prov'd; nor is there any thing in the Inſtances above, that do in the leaſt bear againſt <hi>Moſes.</hi> For, as I obſerv'd above, <hi>Moſes</hi>
                     <pb n="LXXV" facs="tcp:94724:39"/> does not write Annals, nor date thoſe Facts, and might therefore inſert them in that place of his Book which he judged moſt reaſonable.</p>

                     </gap> is true that this Author does produce one Inſtance that looks like an Objection: And I do grant that the place hath a conſiderable difficulty attending it, and that is what we read <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.6. But becauſe there are ſome difficult paſſages in the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> muſt not <hi>Moſes</hi> therefore be allow'd to be the Author? At this rate we may diſcharge all the Writers of the Old and New Teſtament alſo. But as to that difficult place, it is very particularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd in the following Notes on that Chapter; to which therefore I referr the Reader.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. After all, 'tis very unfit we ſhou'd pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Methods</hi> that God's Holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets are to uſe in revealing his Will to us. 'Tis great ſawcineſs in us to preſcribe. God is wiſe when he does not uſe our methods.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> XX. The ſame Author objects the Obſcurity of theſe Books as an Argument that <hi>Moſes</hi> was not the Author of them. To which I anſwer,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is not to be wonder'd that there ſhou'd be ſome obſcure places in the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing it to be written by <hi>Moſes;</hi> for then the Book was written above 3000 years ago, and that in the Eaſtern Country, and in a Language much different from the Modern: We are not acquainted with the Hiſtory of that Age, the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms
<pb n="LXXVI" facs="tcp:94724:40"/> of thoſe Times, and Idiotiſms of the Language in which it was written. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are apt to miſtake, and many times at a loſs where theſe Books referr to ſome Facts or Records, or Rites and Uſages then well known. But then (as I intimated) this is no Argument that <hi>Moſes</hi> was not the Author of it: For this wou'd oblige us to diſcharge all the ancient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors which we do not underſtand.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Beſides, this Obſcurity is very often to be imputed to a fault or defect of the Readers, not to any defect or fault in the Books. The Reader perhaps wants Skill and good Judgment; he does not uſe fit means or ſufficient diligence: Perhaps he is prejudic'd with falſe Notions, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to ſome fooliſh Opinions, or blinded with ſome naughty and vicious Inclin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ſion. And to ſuch a Reader many Things ſeem obſcure. But ſtill the Reader is blameable, not the Book. He is in this Caſe like the blind Woman in <hi>Seneca,</hi> who cou'd not be perſwaded but that the Houſe was dark, when her Eyes were blinded: There are ſome obſcure paſſages in Holy Writ, but theſe Holy Books are not therefore to be diſcharg'd from being the Writing of thoſe perſons whoſe Names they bear. There are very many things exceeding plain to the Reader, and many things that are not ſo, are yet very excellent, and to be reputed ſo by a modeſt Reader. When <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> had read a Book written by <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> and was ask'd how he lik'd the Book, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>: i. e. <hi>Thoſe things in it</hi> (ſays he) <hi>which I underſtood are excellent; and ſo, I preſume, are the things which I did not underſtand.</hi> This modeſty becomes us well in reading the Holy Scriptures. Where every carefull Reader will not fail to meet with a great many very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent things which he will eaſily underſtand, he ought to preſume ſo of thoſe things which he does not comprehend.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> XXI. I find it objected alſo, that there is a different Style in the ſeveral parts of the <hi>Pentateuch;</hi> and that therefore 'twas not writ by <hi>Moſes,</hi> but by ſeveral Hands. I anſwer,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That if this were true, it muſt be allow'd to be a very material Objection; and though it wou'd not be altogether concluding, yet it wou'd have more weight than all that hath been ſaid before.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But 'tis ſo far from being true, that the Objector does impoſe upon the more ignorant Reader in this matter. For which matter, I do appeal to all thoſe that underſtand the Biblical Hebrew, and that have been moſt converſant in it. The Objector ought to have offer'd ſome proofs of this; at leaſt to have told us where any ſuch diverſity of Style appears, and till he does that he cannot expect any other anſwer. I do grant that in other Books, written by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Hands, this diverſity of Style does mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly appear. The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> writes in a ſtyle that is <hi>lofty</hi> and <hi>ſublime; Jeremiah</hi> on the
<pb n="LXXVIII" facs="tcp:94724:41"/> other hand in a <hi>ſtyle</hi> that is more <hi>vulgar</hi> and <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular.</hi> Some other parts are written in a <hi>ſtyle</hi> that is <hi>conciſe</hi> and <hi>elliptical,</hi> ſome in a <hi>ſtyle</hi> more <hi>ample</hi> and <hi>copious:</hi> And as they were written by ſeveral Hands, ſo there is that variety in <hi>ſtyle</hi> that wou'd induce the Reader to this belief. But I do ſolemnly averr, That there is no ſuch variety in the ſtyle of the <hi>Pentateuch</hi> that gives any colour to ſuch a belief. 'Tis true that the <hi>Songs</hi> in <hi>Moſes</hi> are ſomewhat different from the <hi>ſtyle</hi> of his <hi>Proſe,</hi> and ſome few expreſſions may be allow'd to be more <hi>elliptical</hi> and <hi>conciſe;</hi> but all this ſtill is not ſuch a difference as can inferr him not to be the Writer, and are ſuch Things as muſt be allow'd elſewhere in one and the ſame Writer, and Book.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> XXII. The laſt Objection, and the moſt common of all, is, That <hi>Moſes</hi> cou'd not write what we read, (<hi>Deut.</hi> 34.) The account of his Death and Burial, and his Character. This therefore muſt be allow'd to be written by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Hand. I anſwer,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That it is abſurd to ſay that he cou'd not, when 'tis remembred that he was not onely a Prophet, but the greateſt of Prophets. There are leſs Prophets than <hi>Moſes</hi> that tell us many Things that came not to paſs till after their own Death: And therefore if I ſhou'd affirm that he wrote this by way of Prophecy, as I ſhou'd not be alone in affirming it, but ſhou'd have good Authority from Antiquity on my
<pb n="LXXIX" facs="tcp:94724:41"/> ſide; ſo I am ſure I cannot be confuted by any of thoſe who have abdicated <hi>Moſes. Philo</hi> the Jew [<hi>de vit. Moſ. l.</hi> 3.] tells us that <hi>Moſes,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Death, did fore-tell what Things ſhou'd happen to the ſeveral Tribes; <hi>Some of which things</hi> (ſays he) <hi>are already come to paſs, ſome of them are expected.</hi> But then he adds, That <hi>Moſes being juſt going to Heaven,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>being as yet living, and divinely inſpired, did diſtinctly fore-tell thoſe things which related to his own Death and Burial.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. As to this matter, every Man may believe as he ſees cauſe. I am very little concern'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it; if he wrote the <hi>Pentateuch</hi> to this, <hi>Deut.</hi> 34. where we have the account of his Death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I am ſatisfied. Let what follows be written by another, whether <hi>Joſhua,</hi> or the <hi>High-prieſt,</hi> or ſome other authorized Perſon, this will do the Objectors little ſervice as to the main purpoſe, and me no harm at all. He that believes St. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote the Epiſtles that go under his Name, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves enough as to that matter, though he ſhou'd at the ſame time believe the <hi>Poſt-ſcripts</hi> at the cloſe of thoſe Epiſtles were written by another Hand. Again, he that believes the Book of <hi>Pſalms</hi> an inſpir'd Book, and written by thoſe Perſons whoſe Names they bear; believes enough, tho' at the ſame time he might believe that the words, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72.20. <hi>The prayers of David, the ſon of Jeſſe are ended,</hi> were written by another Hand, to intimate that there ended one of the Books, (for the <hi>Jews</hi> made a <hi>Pentateuch</hi> of the Book of
<pb n="LXXX" facs="tcp:94724:42"/> 
                     <hi>Pſalms,</hi>) and in the following <hi>Pſalm</hi> another Book begins. But after all, I do not ſee why what I ſaid before, under the firſt Head, ſhou'd be receiv'd with ſuch laughter and ſcorn as I find it is. And though I think the Cauſe will not ſuffer by this Conceſſion, yet I do not quit my firſt Anſwer.</p>
                  <p>And thus I have conſider'd the Pretences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Moſes.</hi> I have repreſented Them with all the advantage on my Adverſaries ſide that I poſſibly cou'd, and have endeavour'd to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Arguments as pungent and ſtrong as I cou'd; and have ſometimes found it a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter difficulty to ſharpen them, and make them appear like Arguments, than it was to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer them. I find <hi>Moſes</hi> hath a good Title to the <hi>Author</hi> of theſe Books; A Title that a good Man eſteems more valuable than Crowns and Scepters, and that hath preſerv'd the Name of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and made it Renowned. Some few People have attempted to deprive him of this Honour. I find nothing of any moment in the above-named Pretences, and therefore muſt own him to be the Author of them ſtill.</p>

                     <head>THE General Argument OF THE Firſt Book of <hi>MOSES,</hi> CALLED GENESIS.</head>
                     <p>THE <hi>Jews</hi> call the ſeveral Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which follow, by Names that are taken from the firſt Hebrew word, or words, with which thoſe Books begin. Hence it is that this Book is by them commonly called <hi>Bereſhith,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>in the beginning,</hi> that being the firſt word with which this Book begins. But the Names by which they are known among Chriſtians, are taken from the Subject-matter contained in them. Hence it is that this firſt Book is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called <hi>GENESIS,</hi> becauſe it gives an account of the Original of this viſible World, and lays before us not onely an account of the
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:94724:44"/> Creation of the World in general, but particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly an account of the making of <hi>Man,</hi> and of the Deſcents of ſeveral Families from the firſt Parents of Mankind. With relation whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, it is very fitly called <hi>GENESIS,</hi> that Greek word very properly expreſſing the <hi>Original</hi> or firſt <hi>Formation</hi> of theſe things.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Moſes</hi> very wiſely begins this Book with an account of God's Creation of the World, and the ſeveral parts thereof, <hi>chap.</hi> 1. And his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in that matter will more manifeſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, if we conſider that, (1.) By ſo doing he lays a foundation for Piety and Religion, and Obedience of the Laws which follow. The Creation of the World ſpeaks the irreſiſtible <hi>Power,</hi> the deep <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and the great <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of the Creator. A due ſenſe whereof doth mightily diſpoſe us to the <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>love</hi> of God, and to a <hi>ſtedfaſt faith</hi> and <hi>affiance</hi> in Him. (2.) By this courſe he alſo ſtrikes at the very root of <hi>Idolatry:</hi> For that being nothing but the Worſhip of a <hi>Creature</hi> inſtead of the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> nothing can tend more effectually to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it than this belief, That all other things were made by God; That they had not their Being from themſelves, but were made as well as Man: For then it follows, That how uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſoever theſe things may be to us, yet Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worſhip is due onely to the <hi>Creator.</hi> The account which <hi>Moſes</hi> gives of the Creation of Man is alſo very uſefull and inſtructive to us. For as he lets us know that Man was made in
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:94724:44"/> God's Image, ſo that conſideration obligeth us to do nothing unbecoming the Dignity of our Nature, and to be kind to each other for God's ſake: And we may, from the account of the Body's being made of the Earth, learn to be humble and modeſt. In a word, we may from this relation learn Juſtice and Charity, Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Humility, not to wrong or proudly inſult over our Neighbour.</p>
                     <p>The Sanctification of the Sabbath, in memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Creation, puts us in mind of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation which lies upon us to celebrate the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Perfections, which may be learned from God's Works, and the neceſſity of ſome ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and ſolemn time for this Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. So that a very great part of our duty to God, our Neighbour, and our Selves, is very powerfully urged upon us in the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this Sacred Book.</p>
                     <p>We have alſo an account (<hi>chap.</hi> 2.) of the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> and of the Forbidding the Eating of the Tree of Knowledge, of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the Creatures, and of the Inſtitution of Marriage.</p>
                     <p>Next follows an account of the Diſobedience of our firſt Parents, of their Fall, and of their Miſery thereupon; and alſo a gracious Promiſe of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> chap. 3.</p>
                     <p>We may very well grant that theſe firſt Chapters of <hi>Geneſis</hi> do inſinuate ſome farther meaning than the bare Letter amounts to. We yield that there is couched a Myſtery under
<pb n="vj" facs="tcp:94724:45"/> the Letter. 'Tis agreeable to the belief of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to allow this. But ſtill the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is to be preſerved, and not to be queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any means. Much leſs is it to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by profane Wits. For there is no incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence in this. And he that would attempt to deſtroy the Letter of <hi>Moſes,</hi> is ſo far from ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any wiſe or good End, that he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines Religion, offends its Votaries, and gives its Enemies occaſion to rejoice and triumph.</p>
                     <p>There are a great many paſſages in the Old Teſtament, that beſides the firſt <hi>literal</hi> mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, have a farther reference, and <hi>ſpiritual</hi> ſenſe, which yet does by no means deſtroy the <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> in the opinion of thoſe very Men who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for this <hi>ſpiritual</hi> ſenſe, and reference. And for the paſſages in theſe three firſt Chapters in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> the literal ſenſe is very much confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Citations of them, which we find in the inſpired Writers of the New Teſtament. <hi>V. g.</hi> That paſſage, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.3. is cited by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6.

And <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.24. is cited by our Saviour, <hi>Matt.</hi> 19.5. and by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> more than once, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.31. That paſſage of the Serpent's beguiling of <hi>Eve, Gen.</hi> 3. is cited by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and by that Quotation the literal ſenſe is confirmed, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.3. His Words are theſe: <hi>I fear leſt by any means, as the Serpent beguiled Eve through his ſubtlety, ſo your minds ſhould be corrupted from the ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city

                     <p n="1">I. Here's the beſt account of prime Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity: Of the Original of the World, and the
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:94724:49"/> Order in which the ſeveral Parts of it were framed. Here's the cleareſt account of the Deſtruction of the living Creatures by the Floud, and of the Peopling the New World by the Sons of <hi>Noah.</hi> Here we may find the moſt ancient Account of the ſeveral People, who were the Heads of Families and Nations: There's nothing extant in the World that can vye with this Book in this reſpect.

                        <hi>Abel</hi> was one of them, who obtained a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Teſtimony that he was Righteous, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.4. <hi>Enoch</hi> was another who <hi>pleaſed God,</hi> (v. 5.) <hi>being an example of repentance to all ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations,</hi> Eccluſ. 44.16. <hi>Noah</hi> was alſo a Man of ſingular Piety, <hi>an heir of the Righteouſneſs which is by Faith,</hi> Heb. 11.7. <hi>A juſt Man, and perfect in his Generations,</hi> Gen. 6.9.

<pb n="xviij" facs="tcp:94724:51"/> Old Age; the Son of all the Promiſes, and that was to inherit his Subſtance when God required him to do it. Here is a Mirror of true Religion indeed; one who deſervedly bears the Name of the Father of the <hi>Faithfull: In glory there was none like unto him—and when he was proved, he was found faithfull,</hi> Eccluſ. 44.19, 20.</p>
                     <p>He propagated true Religion by his Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Care: It continued in his Family: <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> are in that Liſt of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. <hi>Job</hi> is famous in the Old and New Teſtament; and he is reckoned among his Deſcendants: His Couſin <hi>Lot</hi> is alſo reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among the Righteous.

                        <hi>Sarah</hi> is reckoned among the Worthies, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. She is propounded as a great Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern to married Women by St. <hi>Peter, Whoſe daughters ye are</hi> (ſays he) <hi>as long as ye do well,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.6.</p>
                     <p>His <hi>Servant</hi> is a moſt conſpicuous Example to all Servants. Let Servants read <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. and they will ſoon ſee the truth of this matter. He uſed in his Maſter's buſineſs all diligence; ſhewed the greateſt care and fidelity; made the utmoſt diſpatch; preferred his Maſter's affair before his own eaſe and refreſhment; expreſſed his Truſt in God for his ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>One Example more I will name, and that is that of <hi>Joſeph.</hi> His Story is very wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and his Life a great Pattern. He ſhewed
<pb n="xix" facs="tcp:94724:51"/> great Piety towards his Father, Mercy and Forgiveneſs towards his Brethren. He was a Man of ſingular Wiſdom, and dexterity in Buſineſs; Of great Probity, and inflexible In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity. His reſiſting the importunity of his Miſtreſs is an Example of Vertue never to be forgotten. He was then a Servant, in a ſtrange Country.

It is certain that theſe words cannot be meant of the Expiration of his ſeven years ſervice. And that will appear to any Man who ſhall conſider the following Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars. [I.] This would ſuppoſe that <hi>Jacob</hi> had twelve Children in the ſpace of ſeven years, <hi>Gen.</hi> 30.25.31.41. which is by no means allowable. For <hi>Leah</hi> had ſeven at ſeven ſeveral Births, which might well take up ſeven years. Beſides, 'tis certain, that ſhe intermitted bearing for ſome time, <hi>Gen.</hi> 29.35.30.17. And in the mean time we have an account of the birth of <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Naphtali, Gad</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſher,</hi> before <hi>Leah</hi> bore <hi>Iſſachar, Zebulun</hi> and <hi>Dinah, Gen.</hi> 30. [II.] This Opinion ſuppoſeth <hi>Reuben</hi> to have been but about four years old at moſt, when he brought the Mandrakes mentioned <hi>Gen.</hi> 30.14. For after this, his Mother (not being then with Child) bore three Children at three ſeveral births. And it is probable, that <hi>Joſeph</hi> was born after this, <hi>Gen.</hi> 30.22. [III.] The conſideration of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s age (who was, when he went to <hi>Laban,</hi> about ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty ſix years old) and the birth of <hi>Hezron</hi> and <hi>Hamul (ch.</hi> 46.12) forbids us to receive this Opinion, according to which <hi>Judah</hi> could not be above three or four years older than <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and conſequently, could not be above forty three or forty four years old when he, with his Grand-children, went into <hi>Egypt (Joſeph</hi> being then, at moſt, but forty years old, <hi>Gen.</hi> 41.46.) To compoſe this, it muſt be ſuppos'd (by thoſe who would defend this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion) That <hi>Judah</hi> married at twelve, and had <hi>Er</hi> when he was thirteen years old; That <hi>Er</hi> married at twelve and <hi>Onan</hi> at the ſame age. <hi>Tamar</hi> ſtaid for <hi>Shelah</hi> after the <hi>days were multiplied</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi>'s Wife died, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 38.12.) and then ſhe bore <hi>Pharez</hi> to <hi>Judah:</hi> We will allow but three years for this. And then ſuppoſing <hi>Pharez</hi> to marry at twelve years of age, and that he had <hi>Hezron</hi> and <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mul</hi> (ſuppoſing them twins) at the age of thirteen, and
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:94724:127"/> that they went into <hi>Egypt</hi> at one year old. All this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts but to forty three years. Theſe things being duly put together, do juſtify this Interpretation, and ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expoſe that Opinion, That <hi>Jacob</hi> ſerved ſeven years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he married <hi>Leah.

That he did ſo, is indeed no-where elſe mentioned; But that is no objection againſt this ſenſe of the place, which is here ſo fairly intimated. We have to this purpoſe ſundry Examples, where things are by the by related or fairly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated to have been ſaid or done before, which yet were never mentioned before that time. <hi>E. g.</hi> What is ſaid of <hi>Anah,</hi> ch. 36.24. and what God had ſaid to <hi>Moſes</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Moabites,</hi> Deut. 2.9. Of the <hi>Men</hi> of <hi>Jeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho,</hi> Joſh. 24.11. And the words of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> Acts 20.35. I offer, for the farther clearing of this difficult place, the following particulars to be conſidered: [I.] That the <hi>Amorites,</hi> being ſignal for their Idolatry, are ſpoken of as comprehending the <hi>Hivites,</hi> and other Nations under them. Thus we read: <hi>The iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full,</hi> Gen. 15.16. <hi>Fear not the Gods of the Amorites,</hi> Judg. 6.10.
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:94724:175"/> Thus alſo <hi>Ahab</hi> is ſaid to follow Idols, <hi>as did the Amorites, whom the Lord caſt out before the children of Iſrael,</hi> 1 Kings 21.26. compare 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.11. The whole Land was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted as the Land of the <hi>Amorites,</hi> Amos 2.9, 10. [II.] That though <hi>Jacob</hi> had purchaſed a piece of ground near <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem,</hi> Gen. 33.19, 20. Yet <hi>Shechem</hi> it ſelf, which he here gives <hi>Joſeph,</hi> came to him by Conqueſt, (expreſſed here by <hi>Sword</hi> and <hi>Bow, Joſh.</hi> 24.12. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.22.) and not by Purchaſe. He deteſted indeed the Violence his Sons uſed towards the <hi>Shechemites,</hi> and did not care to come into the preſent poſſeſſion of the place that way: Yet God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving promiſed him that Land, which gave him afterwards an undoubted Title to it; he gives it to <hi>Joſeph</hi> here, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving come into the actual poſſeſſion of it without any ſin or fault of his own. [III.] And therefore <hi>Jacob</hi> might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt.

                     <head>THE General Argument OF THE Second Book of <hi>MOSES,</hi> CALLED EXODUS.</head>
                     <p>THIS Second Book of <hi>Moſes</hi> treats of the <hi>Departure</hi> of the Children of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and with reſpect thereunto it is called <hi>Exodus,</hi> from a Greek word which imports <hi>a Departure</hi> or <hi>going out.</hi> And, though ſome other Matters are herein treated of, yet that is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Subject of this Book. For the main of the other Matters herein related, are either ſuch as were preparatory thereunto, or conſequent thereupon.</p>
                     <p>Of the firſt ſort there are ſeveral Particulars related in this Book: And they are theſe which follow; [I.] The Names of the Children of
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:94724:185"/> 
                        <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the Number of them which came down into <hi>Egypt,</hi> who were of that Race: Of this we have an account, <hi>Exod.</hi> I. <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. [II.] The Miſeries which theſe <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did lie under in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the great Hardſhips which they met with there, of which we have an account in the remaining part of that Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and afterwards, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. [III.] The Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons by whoſe Miniſtry this Deliverance was wrought; and under this Head is to be reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the account we have of <hi>Moſes,</hi> of his Birth, and of his wonderfull Preſervation, and of his Divine Miſſion, (<hi>Ch.</hi> 2 and 3.) and Power given to him to do wonderfull Works: As alſo, that of <hi>Aaron</hi> his Brother, (<hi>ch.</hi> 4. and 6.) [IV.] The Aſſurance which <hi>Moſes</hi> received of his Succeſs in this Undertaking, <hi>ch.</hi> 6. [V.] The Wonders which were wrought, and the Plagues inflicted upon <hi>Pharaoh</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and upon his People to induce them to believe the Divine Miſſion of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> and to let the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> go out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> And we have a particular account of theſe wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Works to the end of the Eleventh Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                     <p>Theſe wonderfull Works deſerve a ſpecial Conſideration: They were wrought to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a belief of the over-ruling Power of the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and that <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> were ſent by him. The Works themſelves were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Power of a Creature: And though the Sorcerers and Magicians of <hi>Egypt</hi> were able in
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:94724:185"/> ſome meaſure to imitate ſome of the firſt Works of <hi>Moſes,</hi> (<hi>ch.</hi> 7.) yet were they forced quickly to give out, and to own the unimitable Power of God. And when they inflicted Evils, they were deſtitute of Power to remove thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, (<hi>ch.</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> 7, 8.). The Magicians of <hi>Egypt</hi> could not produce ſo much as <hi>Lice</hi> out of the Duſt of the Earth, (<hi>ch.</hi> 8.18.) 'twas above their Power; and for the <hi>ſwarm</hi> of <hi>Flies</hi> which were ſent upon the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> the place where the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> dwelt was by the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Providence of God exempted from them, (<hi>ch.</hi> 8.22.) Thus it was alſo in the <hi>Murrain;</hi> it did light on the Cattel of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> but not upon that which belonged to the <hi>Iſraelites, (ch.</hi> 9.) The Plague of <hi>Boyls</hi> ſucceeded, which was ſo grievous upon the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> that the Magicians themſelves could not ſtand before <hi>Moſes, (v.</hi> 11.) The <hi>Hail</hi> with Thunder and Fire came next; but this grievous Plague fell upon the <hi>Egyptians</hi> onely, the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> felt it not, (<hi>v.</hi> 26.) A grievous Plague from the <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſts</hi> followed, and that was followed by a <hi>thick Darkneſs</hi> which affected the <hi>Egyptians</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> enjoying Light as before. And laſtly, the Death of the <hi>Firſt-born,</hi> which ſell onely on thoſe of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and from which the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were excuſed, <hi>ch.</hi> 11.</p>
                     <p>After this wonderfull manner did God think fit to effect and bring to paſs the <hi>Departure</hi> of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> This was a moſt ſignal Bleſſing to that People, and never to be
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:94724:186"/> forgotten. And as God thought fit by <hi>Moſes</hi> to tranſmit to Poſterity the Hiſtory of the Facts relating to this Matter; ſo he appointed a Feſtival (and a very Solemn one) to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually kept by the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in remembrance of it, and appointed the Month in which this <hi>Departure</hi> happened to be for the future ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved as the firſt of (at leaſt) the <hi>[Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal]</hi> year. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> are often put in mind by <hi>Moſes</hi> and the ſucceeding Prophets of this Deliverance; and it is made uſe of as an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement to their Obedience to the Law given them afterwards, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.2. And that they might not forget this Deliverance, they were afterwards obliged to keep up the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of it once every Week on their Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.15. And, beſides all this, to perpetuate the memory of this Deliverance, the firſt-born of Man and Beaſt are to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated, or ſet apart, <hi>Exod.</hi> 13.</p>
                     <p>Of this <hi>Departure</hi> of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> out of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> and of the Solemn Feſtival appointed for a Memorial of it, <hi>viz.</hi> The Paſſover and Feaſt of Unleavened-bread, and the rites thereunto belonging, we have an account, <hi>ch.</hi> 12. and 13.</p>
                     <p>When the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> Went from <hi>Egypt,</hi> God took care of them, and directed their Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies by a certain <hi>Pillar,</hi> which in the Day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared as a <hi>Cloud</hi> and as <hi>Fire</hi> in the Night, (<hi>ch.</hi> 13.21, 22.) And whereas the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were ſo hardy as to purſue them, God miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly ſaves the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> by giving them a
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:94724:186"/> paſſage through the <hi>Red-Sea,</hi> and drowns the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians</hi> which followed them, (<hi>ch.</hi> 14.) In memory whereof we have a Solemn Hymn or Song of <hi>Moſes, (ch.</hi> 15.)</p>
                     <p>I will now repreſent the Facts that were conſequent upon this Deliverance. The bitter Waters of <hi>Marah</hi> were made ſweet by <hi>Moſes, (ch.</hi> 15.25.) And when the People wanted Bread, they were miraculouſly ſupplied with <hi>Quails</hi> and <hi>Manna, ch.</hi> 16. And when they wanted Water they are ſupplied with it from a <hi>Rock</hi> in <hi>Horeb.</hi> When they were aſſaulted by <hi>Amalek</hi> they prevailed whiles <hi>Moſes</hi> held up his hands; in memory of which Victory an Altar is built, (<hi>ch.</hi> 17.) Next follows an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the coming of <hi>Jethro,</hi> of his Recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Counſel he gave him, <hi>ch.</hi> 18.</p>
                     <p>And now were the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> come to the Wilderneſs in <hi>Sinai</hi> in the third Month after they were come from <hi>Egypt:</hi> And here God gives them the Law, and that he does in a manner that was very ſolemn and awfull. <hi>Moſes</hi> goes up into a Mountain, where God inſtructs him what he ſhould ſay to the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> the better to prepare them for receiving the Law, and returns their anſwer unto <hi>God.</hi> He is ſent down to them again to ſanctify them, and warn them: And God ſent him a third time, with a charge to them to keep their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. The Mountain was in a ſmoke, and God deſcended on it in Fire, and it quaked,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:94724:187"/> and the People were terrified, <hi>chap.</hi> 19.</p>
                     <p>This was a fit time and place for them to receive their Law. They had a little before received many proofs of the Power of God, and of his care of them, which might diſpoſe them to Obedience to God's Law. They were in a Wilderneſs, a place of receſs and leiſure: They were freed from the Slavery of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and from the Idolatrous Examples of the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians:</hi> On the other hand, they were ſhort of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and ſo not diverted by Wars with that People, nor acquainted with their filthy Practices and idolatrous Rites, nor rendred dull and ſtupid by the Plenty and Proſperities of that Land. And therefore was this a moſt fit ſeaſon for this Solemnity. 'Twas God's great care that his People ſhould neither imitate the People of <hi>Egypt,</hi> whence they came, nor of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> whither they were going. This he told them elſewhere by <hi>Moſes; After the doings of the Land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>wherein ye dwelt: and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the doings of the Land of</hi> Canaan, <hi>whither I bring you, ſhall ye not do: neither ſhall ye walk in their Ordinances,</hi> Levit. 18.3. To have given this Law in <hi>Egypt</hi> might have been too ſoon, and to have done it when they were poſſeſſed of <hi>Canaan,</hi> might have been too late. Here they are placed between both, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely delivered from <hi>Egypt,</hi> and unacquainted with <hi>Canaan,</hi> and conſequently the better diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to receive God's Law. And whereas they had been miraculouſly brought out of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi>
                        <pb n="267" facs="tcp:94724:187"/> and on that conſideration were obliged in <hi>Gratitude</hi> to Obedience, ſo not being yet poſſeſſed of <hi>Canaan,</hi> they were now obliged by th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>After this we have an account of the calling of <hi>Moſes</hi> up into the Mountain, of his writing of this Law of God, called afterwards, <hi>The Book of the Covenant;</hi> of his building an Altar, and cauſing Sacrifices to be ſlain, and ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entring the People into a Covenant to obey this Law which had been made known to them. Upon which <hi>Moſes</hi> is called up into the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, promiſed Tables of Stone, and continued in the Mount forty Days and forty Nights, <hi>ch.</hi> 24.</p>
                     <p>Thus did things ſtand between God and the <hi>Iſraelites:</hi> He had given his Law (a great and peculiar favour this was) and they had not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly promiſed Obedience, but had ſolemnly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into Covenant to make their promiſe good. In ſuch an happy caſe were this People now, whoſe God was the Lord.</p>

                     <p>Whiles <hi>Moſes</hi> continues in the Mount, when God had done ſuch great things for <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and was deſigning for them farther pledges of his Favour, the People fell into a great ſin.

Upon which <hi>Aaron</hi> makes them a Golden Calf, which the People worſhipped WITH God. For 'tis not credible, that they had intirely renounced the true God which had done ſuch Wonders for them. Upon this is God greatly diſpleaſed with the People, and <hi>Moſes</hi> caſts down the Tables of Stone, and breaks them; many of the People were deſtroyed, and God lets them know his great diſpleaſure for their grievous fault, <hi>ch.</hi> 32.</p>

                     <p>Upon this <hi>Moſes</hi> is commanded to hew two Tables of Stone, and God promiſes to write on them as he had on the former. <hi>Moſes</hi> is called into the Mount, whither he goes with the two Tables: The Name of God is there proclaimed, being full of Mercy and Benigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; upon which <hi>Moſes</hi> intercedes for the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and God Covenants with them, and puts them in mind of their duty in ſeveral inſtances. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſtays in the Mount forty Days and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Nights faſting, comes down with the two Tables, with his Face ſhining, and commands the People to obey God in keeping the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, <hi>ch.</hi> 34 and 35. <hi>v.</hi> 2.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> Here is great <hi>variety</hi> of Argument to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>tertain us with. If <hi>Hiſtory</hi> will entertain us, here is a moſt remarkable one: Here we have
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:94724:190"/> the Hiſtory of the birth and preſervation of <hi>Moſes,</hi> of the <hi>Wonders</hi> wrought in <hi>Egypt;</hi> of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> moſt <hi>miraculous</hi> deliverance thence; of their <hi>travel</hi> in the <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> and the <hi>won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous</hi> things which happened there. If we be taken with the knowledge of <hi>Laws,</hi> here we ſhall find that which will entertain us alſo. For beſides the moral Precepts (in which all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind are concerned) we have an account of the Laws of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> by which they were to be governed in their own Land: And tho' it be true, that theſe judicial Laws were given to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and that they were concerned in them, and that other Nations muſt be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by the Laws of their ſeveral Countries, yet, certain it is, that the Juſtice and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, on which theſe Laws are founded, and which they recommend, are worthy the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration and imitation too of other Nations. And if inquiſitive perſons think it worth their while to look into the Laws of <hi>Sparta,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> and other Kingdoms and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths, certainly they muſt judge the Laws of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which came from God himſelf, are well worthy their looking into, and their ſerious conſideration. <hi>Again,</hi> if <hi>Religion,</hi> or the way of worſhipping God, and the Holy Rites and Ceremonies thereunto belonging, will entertain us, we have here ſome account of that alſo (and a farther afterwards) and of the <hi>Perſons</hi> appointed to miniſter in Holy Things, of their Veſtments, Separation and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:94724:190"/> Conſecration to their Office: Or, laſtly, If our Curioſity leads us to conſider curious <hi>Mechaniſm,</hi> or the <hi>Work</hi> of the moſt able <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,</hi> we have an account of the Structure of the Tabernacle, of its ſeveral parts and dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, of its Inſtruments and Utenſils, and the curious Work made uſe of about that and the Prieſt's Holy Garments.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Here is alſo to be found a Symbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Repreſentation of better things to come. For ſeveral Matters related here, are Symbols and Types of ſomething elſe which was to be revealed in the days of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> which does mightily enhanſe the value of theſe Relations, and which exalts them above the rate of other Relations. It would be too long to dilate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Particulars; I ſhall onely obſerve, that the Redemption of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> from <hi>Egypt</hi> was a great <hi>Symbol</hi> and <hi>Type</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s far greater Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of Mankind. And that the Structure and Frame of the Tabernacle was a Type alſo of Evangelical Things. And whoever will take the pains to compare what <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſays of the parts of the Sanctuary, and the myſtical meaning thereof with what is ſaid by the Divine Author of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> on that occaſion, will be farther convinced of the truth hereof.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This Book lays before us a lively <hi>Idea</hi> of God's ſpecial Providence and Care of his People, and conſequently lays a great foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for Piety, particularly, for Obedience to his Precepts, and truſt and affiance in him
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:94724:191"/> under all Events. <hi>Moſes</hi> is preſerved notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all Arts uſed to deſtroy him: The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> live and increaſe under the ſevereſt hardſhips. The Buſh is burnt with Fire, but not conſumed. All the Wit, and Malice, and Power of Men cannot defeat God's Counſels, nor deſtroy the People whom he will preſerve. They whom God will ſave Man cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy. They are ſafe who are under his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. He can find Meat and Drink for them in a barren Wilderneſs. While they obey and follow God they are ſafe. And therefore our greateſt Care and higheſt Wiſdom is with all imaginable care to do the Will of God, and then to truſt to him for a ſupply of our Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, and a defence againſt our Enemies, and a certain relief under our moſt preſſing ſtraits and difficulties. And all this is powerfully recommended to us from the Matters laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us in this Book of <hi>Moſes</hi> called <hi>Exodus.</hi>

                           <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.14.) Nor can the words be underſtood of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Name; but it is, <hi>by my name JEHOVAH was I not known,</hi> &amp;c. By this name muſt be underſtood that which it doth ſignifie. <hi>JEHOVAH</hi> denotes not onely God's Eternal Being, but his giving of Being to other things, and eſpecially the performing his Promiſe. Now <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> had received Promiſes, but enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not the thing promiſed: The time was now come in which God would bring to paſs what he had promiſed; and now they ſhould know that he is the <hi>Lord, V. Iſa.</hi> 49.23. <hi>c.</hi> 52.6. <hi>c.</hi> 60.16. The knowing him by his name <hi>JEHOVAH</hi> implies the receiving from him what he had promiſed before. He is not called <hi>JEHOVAH</hi> till he had finiſhed the Creation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.4. The doing of that which He before decreed and promiſed ſpeaks Him to be <hi>JEHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VAH.</hi> See <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.2. This Interpretation agrees exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the Context. For in the very next words God lets them know, that he would make good his Promiſe, which is expreſſed by eſtabliſhing his <hi>Covenant,</hi> v. 4. and declares, that he remembers his Covenant, <hi>v.</hi> 5. And then follow theſe words, <hi>Wherefore ſay unto the children of Iſrael, I am</hi> JEHOVAH, <hi>and I will bring you out,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>V.</hi> 6. with <hi>v.</hi> 7, 8. For the farther clearing of this matter it is to be remembred, That God is ſaid to make himſelf known to thoſe whom he takes into Covenant. Thus, in <hi>Judah is God known,</hi> Pſal. 76.1. Again, <hi>In the day when I choſe Iſrael, and lifted up mine hand unto the ſeed of the houſe of Jacob, and made my ſelf known unto them in the land of Egypt; when I lifted up my hand unto them, ſaying, I am the Lord your God: In the day that I lifted up my hand unto them, to bring them forth of the land of Egypt into a land that I had eſpied for them,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.5, 6. When God entred into Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> it was by the name of <hi>God Almighty,</hi> Gen. 17.1. upon which he promiſeth to his Seed the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> v. 8. By this name <hi>Iſaac</hi> bleſſeth <hi>Jacob</hi> and beſtows on him the Bleſſing of <hi>Abraham,</hi> ch. 28.3, 4. By this name <hi>Jacob</hi> bleſſeth <hi>Joſeph,</hi> ch. 48.3.49.25. God lets them here know, that he who had made a Promiſe to their Fathers by the name of <hi>God Almighty,</hi> would now confirm His Covenant to them, and make his Promiſe good by the name of <hi>JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HOVAH. Say unto the children of Iſrael, I am JEHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VAH:</hi>

                     <head>THE General Argument OF THE Third Book of <hi>MOSES,</hi> CALLED LEVITICUS.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>LEVI</hi> was the third Son of <hi>Jacob:</hi> From him his Poſterity had the name of <hi>Levites: Aaron,</hi> who, with his Sons, was called to the Prieſthood, was from him called a <hi>Levite,</hi> Exod. 4.14. And that Prieſthood that was ſetled in that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily is called <hi>Levitical,</hi> Heb. 7.11. The Law relating to the diſcharge of the Prieſt's Office is properly called the <hi>Levitical</hi> Law; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that account that Book of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which more eſpecially treats of the Holy Rites and Services, in which theſe Prieſts were by their Office imployed, is very fitly, from the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject-matter of it, called <hi>Leviticus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And this is the main Subject of this very excellent Book, as will more clearly appear afterwards.</p>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:94724:292"/>
                     <p>And becauſe a great part of the Prieſt's Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice was taken up in attendance upon the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, and he was nearly concerned in the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and holy Oblations which were preſented by the People; and becauſe this Book treats largely of thoſe Sacrifices, and the Rites there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto belonging, and that in the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it. I know not how to let the Reader into the Book it ſelf, any better way, than by premiſing ſomething concerning the Sacrifices themſelves which are here treated of. And to that purpoſe I ſhall,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> Conſider the matter of theſe Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or what things they were which were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired or allowed to be offered at the Altar.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall conſider the ſeveral ſorts or kinds of theſe Sacrifices, with the particular Laws annexed unto them; and ſhall in this matter offer nothing but what the Text of the Law gives me ground for.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I ſhall in very few words ſhew how very uſefull it is to underſtand this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. I ſhall conſider the matter of theſe Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, or what things they were which were required or allowed to be offered at the Altar.</p>
                     <p>And theſe Oblations being either of living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or of things that were inanimate, I ſhall,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> Conſider what living Creatures were admitted for Sacrifices, where theſe Sacrifices were bloudy. And they were Five onely; <hi>viz.</hi> Out of the Herd, the <hi>Bullock</hi> onely; Out of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94724:292"/> the Flock, the <hi>Sheep</hi> and the <hi>Goat;</hi> From a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Fowls, the <hi>Turtle-Dove,</hi> and the <hi>leſs</hi> or <hi>younger Pigeon.</hi> More than theſe were not allowed by the Law. For the <hi>Birds</hi> (rendred <hi>Sparrows</hi> in the Marginal reaching, <hi>Levit.</hi> 14.) they belong not at all to this matter. For I am ſpeaking here of bloudy Sacrifices: For thoſe Birds, one of them was not killed, and neither of them had any relation to God's Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar. Theſe living Creatures, admitted for Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, were ſuch as were <hi>common</hi> and <hi>eaſy</hi> to be procured: Beſides, they were <hi>tame</hi> and <hi>gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi> very <hi>innocent,</hi> and <hi>uſefull</hi> and <hi>harmleſs:</hi> No ravenous Beaſts are admitted, no Birds of prey. What more uſefull than a Bullock, more profitable than a Sheep and Goat, more ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and harmleſs than a Dove or Pigeon? And if the Obſervation of <hi>Philo</hi> be true, That the Offerer was to be like his Oblation, then are <hi>innocence</hi> and <hi>induſtry, uſefulneſs</hi> and <hi>ſimplicity</hi> recommended here to the Worſhipper of God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> What things were admitted where the Oblation was of things that were inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate. And ſuch things there were in the Meat-offering, (of which Offering I ſhall ſpeak more particularly afterwards,) <hi>viz. Fine Flour, Oil, Frankincenſe, Salt,</hi> and, in one caſe, <hi>green Ears</hi> of <hi>Corn, (Levit.</hi> 2.1, 14.) and <hi>Wine, Numb.</hi> 15.28.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. The bloudy Sacrifices were of four ſorts; and they were theſe: The <hi>Holocauſts</hi> or <hi>whole Burnt-offerings,</hi> the <hi>Sin-offerings,</hi> the <hi>Treſpaſs-offerings,</hi>
                        <pb n="6" facs="tcp:94724:293"/> and the <hi>Peace-offerings.</hi> A ſhort account of which, the Reader may take as follows.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Holocauſt</hi> or <hi>Burnt-offering</hi> deſerves to be conſidered firſt; For ſo it is by <hi>Moſes</hi> in this Book of <hi>Leviticus.</hi> Beſides, it hath been thought to be the moſt ancient kind of Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; and certain it is, that it is in it ſelf the moſt perfect, and comprehenſive, and ſpeaks the greateſt devotion and generoſity (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.31.) in the Offerer. For this Sacrifice was intirely burnt and conſumed, it was all God's; nothing of the Fleſh remained to the Prieſt or to the Offerer, <hi>Levit.</hi> 1.9, 13. It muſt be a Male that is offered in this principal Sacrifice, (<hi>Levit.</hi> 1.3, 10. with <hi>ch.</hi> 22.19.) And though it were expiatory, (<hi>Levit.</hi> 1.3.) yet it does not always ſuppoſe a particular Sin or Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs that obliged the Offerer to bring this kind of Sacrifice. But was as freely offered, and very often as voluntary in all reſpects as any other Offering whatſoever, (<hi>Levit.</hi> 22.18, 19.) Some of theſe were offered for private Perſons, others for the whole Congregation.</p>
                     <p>For the <hi>whole Congregation</hi> there were a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain number fixed and ſtated, and continually offered up year by year. Two were offered up daily, beſides the Additionals on every Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, New Moon, and Feſtival, the number of which (reckoning 365 days in a year) comes to no leſs than 1243 Head of the Herd and Flock, as may ſoon be collected from <hi>Numb. ch.</hi> 28. and <hi>ch.</hi> 29.</p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:94724:293"/>
                     <p>Some were for <hi>private perſons,</hi> and upon par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular occaſions and emergencies; the number of which cannot therefore be preciſely taken, as may be done in thoſe above-named. There were many Occaſions which when they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened (and that they frequently did) required an <hi>Holocauſt</hi> by the Letter of the Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> and there were many alſo that were vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily offered; and I leave the Reader to collect theſe Occaſions from the Books of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi> For I ſhou'd be too large, if I ſhould in this place very particularly inſiſt upon all thoſe matters which would fall under this Head. I proceed therefore to</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Sin-offering:</hi> This ſuppoſeth a Sin an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent, and that of the Congregation or of a private Perſon. For there are of them alſo (as hath been obſerved of the <hi>Holocauſts,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) ſome that were offered up for the Sins of the Congregation, and others for the Sins of private Perſons, as appears abundantly from <hi>Leviticus,</hi> ch. 4. But there is another diviſion of <hi>Sin-offerings</hi> which is very much to be heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: For whereas, generally ſpeaking, the Prieſt did partake of the <hi>Sin-offering,</hi> (though the Offerer never did) as appears <hi>Levit.</hi> 6.26, 29. and <hi>ch.</hi> 10.17. Yet there were ſome <hi>Sin-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> in which the Prieſt did not partake, <hi>v. g.</hi> when he offered a <hi>Sin-offering</hi> for <hi>himſelf,</hi> or for the <hi>whole Congregation,</hi> (Levit. 4.) Here (as in the whole Burnt-offering) all was burnt, and beſides that, without the Camp alſo. We
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94724:294"/> have a general Rule in this caſe in the words which follow: <hi>No Sin-offering whereof</hi> any <hi>of the bloud is brought into the tabernacle of the congregation to reconcile</hi> withall <hi>in the holy</hi> place, <hi>ſhall be eaten: it ſhall be burnt in the fire,</hi> Levit. 6.30. There is ſtill a third diviſion of the Sin-offerings, and it is this; <hi>viz.</hi> That ſome of them were <hi>fixed</hi> and <hi>determined;</hi> i. e. The Offerer knew what certain Offering he muſt in that caſe bring: Some of them were unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, and, as occaſion was, might admit of <hi>more</hi> or <hi>leſs. E. g.</hi> Thus the <hi>Sin-offering</hi> for the <hi>Prieſt</hi> was determined; it muſt be a <hi>young Bullock,</hi> Levit. 4.3. The <hi>whole Congregation</hi> is obliged to the ſame, <hi>v.</hi> 14. The <hi>Ruler</hi> in that caſe was obliged to offer a <hi>Kid</hi> of <hi>the Goats,</hi> and that a <hi>Male</hi> alſo, <hi>v.</hi> 23. One of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people was obliged to bring a <hi>female Kid</hi> of the <hi>Goats, v.</hi> 28. But in other caſes, and where the Offerer was poor, He was allowed a cheaper Offering inſtead of a more coſtly one; where he was directed to a <hi>Lamb</hi> or a <hi>Kid, (Levit.</hi> 5.6.) yet in caſe of poverty God would accept of two <hi>Turtle-Doves</hi> or two <hi>young Pigeons, (v.</hi> 7.) And when his poverty was very great, God allowed of the <hi>tenth</hi> part of an <hi>Ephah</hi> of <hi>fine Flour</hi> for his <hi>Sin-offering,</hi> and that without the expence of either <hi>Oil</hi> or <hi>Frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe</hi> mingled with it, (<hi>v.</hi> 11.) I proceed to the</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Treſpaſs-offering,</hi> ſtrictly ſo called. We find this Offering different from the Sin-offering in ſeveral particulars. For, (1.) The Sin-offering
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94724:294"/> was ſometime offered for the whole Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well as for private Perſons; but we find no Treſpaſs-offering required for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation. (2.) A Female was allowed for a <hi>Sin-offering,</hi> but a Male was always required in a Treſpaſs-offering, ſtrictly ſo called. [See the Notes on <hi>Levit.</hi> 5.6.] (3.) The Bloud of the <hi>Sin-offering</hi> was to be put upon the Horns, that of the <hi>Treſpaſs-offering</hi> on the ſides of the Altar, <hi>Levit.</hi> 4.7. with <hi>ch.</hi> 7.2. In this indeed they both agreed that they were not to be offered <hi>voluntarily</hi> and at pleaſure, as <hi>Holocauſts</hi> and <hi>Peace-offerings</hi> might. And in this they agreed alſo, that both the one and the other were <hi>moſt Holy,</hi> and the remainder of them to be eaten by the Prieſts onely in the Holy place: And in this reſpect they differed much from the <hi>Holocauſts</hi> and <hi>Peace-offerings;</hi> the firſt whereof had no remainders to be eaten either by Prieſt or Offerer; the latter might be eaten by Prieſt and Offerer, or other perſons that were legally clean, and that in a <hi>clean</hi> place. There are two ſorts of theſe Treſpaſs-offerings mentioned by the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Writers. (1.) There is one which they commonly call <hi>Aſham Talui, i. e.</hi> an <hi>Offering</hi> for a <hi>doubtfull Treſpaſs.</hi> E. g. When a Man was not abſolutely ſure that he had treſpaſſed, but yet ſuſpected he might be guilty of a Treſpaſs that required an Offering, in ſuch a caſe of <hi>ſuſpenſe</hi> he was obliged to this kind of Treſpaſs-offering. For this the <hi>Jews</hi> are ſaid to ground themſelves upon, <hi>Levit.</hi> 5.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94724:295"/> 17, 18. This ſpake a pious care; And <hi>Job</hi> is remembred for his Piety, when he offered up <hi>Holocauſts</hi> daily for his Sons in their days of their feaſting: For <hi>Job</hi> ſaid, <hi>It may be that my Sons have ſinned and curſed God in their hearts,</hi> Job 1.5. There is another (2.) <hi>Treſpaſs-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> for a Treſpaſs that was <hi>certain</hi> and known. And under this Head we find the following Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verals in the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> There was one for the <hi>Nazarite,</hi> who was defiled with the dead, <hi>Numb.</hi> 6.12. Another for the <hi>Leper,</hi> who was to be cleanſed, <hi>Lev.</hi> 14.12. Another for him that had defiled an <hi>Hebrew</hi> Bond-woman, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.20, 21. Another for him that was guilty of Sacrilege, <hi>Lev.</hi> 5.16. And one for him that had failed in Truſt, and defrauded his Neighbour, <hi>Lev.</hi> 6.2, 3, 4, 5, 6. I ſhall now proceed to the remaining ſort of bloudy Sacrifices, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Peace-offerings.</hi> The two laſt kind of Offerings, <hi>viz.</hi> that for Sin and Treſpaſs, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the Offerer obnoxious, and God to be diſpleaſed; and they were appointed for Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Reconciliation. But theſe Offerings ſuppoſe God reconciled to the Offerer, and him to be at peace with God, and in his favour. And as an undeniable proof of that, the Offerer was here admitted to partake of the Altar. For, whereas in the <hi>Holocauſts</hi> the Altar conſumed all the Fleſh of the Sacrifice, neither Prieſt nor People were allowed to partake: And in the <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Treſpaſs-offerings,</hi> though the Prieſts did partake, yet the Offerers had no ſhare al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94724:295"/> them. In theſe Peace-offerings the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers themſelves were admitted to partake of the Sacrifice, and to feaſt upon it. They did partake of the Lord's Table, and that was a ſign of favour and friendſhip: For eating to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether was always eſteemed ſo, and was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore uſed of old in making Covenants and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greements: They who partake of the Altar, have fellowſhip or communion with God, as they are partakers of his Table, <hi>vid.</hi> 1 Cor. 10.16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21. There are three ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſorts of theſe Peace-offerings expreſsly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in this Book of <hi>Leviticus,</hi> (ch. 7.11, 12, 16.) <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Thankſgiving,</hi> the <hi>Vow</hi> and <hi>voluntary</hi> Offering. We muſt know that all theſe Offerings had relation to proſperous things; the firſt of theſe three to ſuch as were already obtained, and did therefore look back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward altogether; the other two looked for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward toward ſome good things in hope or proſpect. The <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Writers obſerve a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the two latter of them in the manner, after which the Offerer obliged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to one or the other of them. He that made a <hi>Vow,</hi> ſaid thus, or to this effect: <hi>Behold I take upon my ſelf an Holocauſt,</hi> or, a <hi>Peace-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> to be offered. But the <hi>voluntary</hi> Offerer ſaid, <hi>Behold ſuch a beaſt</hi> is an <hi>Holocauſt,</hi> or a <hi>Peace-offering.</hi> The difference is very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable. For in the firſt there is an Obligation to a certain kind of Oblation; in the ſecond, the individual Beaſt or thing to be offered is
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94724:296"/> named. So that in the voluntary Offering, if the Beaſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſet aſide for the Offering ſhould chance to periſh before 'twas offered, the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Offerer, was in the ſame moment extinguiſhed. 'Twas otherwiſe in a Vow: For as the Votary is ſuppoſed in ſome ſtrait or danger when he made his Vow, ſo the very form of words in which his Vow is conceived obligeth him to make it good. There is this farther difference between theſe two Offerings, (and the reaſon of it is manifeſt) That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was vowed, muſt be perfect in its kind, for nothing elſe might be ſacrificed: But a leſs perfect Beaſt was accepted in a voluntary Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer; and though the thing that was imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect might not be offered on God's Altar, yet the price of it would be accepted for an holy uſe. The words of the Law are expreſs: <hi>Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Bullock or a Lamb that hath any thing ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous or lacking in its parts, that mayeſt thou offer for a free-will Offering; but for a Vow, it ſhall not be accepted,</hi> Levit. 22.23. This Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation gives great light to the words of the Prophet, <hi>Curſed</hi> be <hi>the deceiver which hath in his flock a male, and voweth and ſacrificeth unto the Lord a corrupt thing,</hi> Mal. 1.14. The <hi>VOWING</hi> and <hi>SACRIFICING</hi> a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt thing was a breach of two Laws, and moſt expreſs Prohibitions.</p>
                     <p>For the <hi>Thankſgiving-offering</hi> 'twas provided (with great reaſon) that it ſhould be eaten the <hi>ſame day,</hi> Levit. 7.15. This obliged the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94724:296"/> to Charity or Hoſpitality: For 'tis not ſuppoſed he could eat it alone. Under this Head are reckoned the <hi>Nazarite</hi>'s Offering, <hi>Numb.</hi> 6.17. The <hi>Paſchal</hi> Lamb, the <hi>Chagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gah</hi> or Feſtival, and additional Offerings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe Peace-offerings were for the <hi>Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,</hi> in which caſe the remainder belonged to the Prieſts; or elſe for private perſons. And then the Sacrifice was divided into three parts. Firſt, there was <hi>God</hi>'s part, which the <hi>Jews</hi> call <hi>Immurim,</hi> which was burnt upon the Altar, or God's Table, of which ſee <hi>Levit.</hi> 3.2, 3, 4, 5. Secondly, the <hi>Prieſt</hi>'s Portion, <hi>viz.</hi> the Breaſt and Shoulder, <hi>Levit.</hi> 7.31, 32. Thirdly, the <hi>Offerer</hi>'s part, which was the reſt of the Fleſh, and above three parts of four of the fleſh of the whole; which might be eaten any-where in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or any <hi>clean</hi> place in the Camp, to which the City anſwered in after-times, <hi>Levit.</hi> 10.14. And it might be eaten by any <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> Man or Woman that were clean. The Peace-offering is not offered of the <hi>Fowls,</hi> but of the Bullock, Sheep or Kid, Male or Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, Small or Great.</p>
                     <p>And this is a more general account of the bloudy Sacrifices, and all the bloudy Sacrifices mentioned in the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> are reducible to one of theſe ſorts, or compounded of them, ſays <hi>Maimon. [Praefat. ad Seder Kodaſhim.]</hi> I proceed to give ſome ſhort account</p>
                     <p>Of the <hi>Meat-offering,</hi> which by the <hi>Jews</hi> is called <hi>Minchah,</hi> which conſiſted of things ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimate,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94724:297"/> as was obſerved before. And ſuch things they were as are of great uſe to the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of life, <hi>viz. Flour, Oil, Wine, Salt,</hi> &amp;c. I will not enlarge upon this Head. Some of theſe Meat-offerings were <hi>ſolitary;</hi> i. e. were offered alone and by themſelves, others were offered with bloudy Sacrifices as <hi>concomitants:</hi> Some without Wine, others with, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>concomitant</hi> ones. Some were for the whole <hi>Congregation,</hi> viz. the <hi>waved ſheaf,</hi> Levit. 23.11. The <hi>two wave loaves,</hi> Levit. 23.17. The <hi>ſhew-bread,</hi> Exod. 25.11. Some for <hi>private</hi> perſons. And under this laſt Head the <hi>Jews</hi> reckon ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. Among which were that for the poor Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, who could not bear the price of a bloudy Sacrifice, <hi>Lev.</hi> 5.11. That for the ſuſpected Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, <hi>Numb.</hi> 5. beſides the voluntary ones.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. I ſhall ſhew in few words how very uſefull it is to underſtand this matter. And ſo it is on ſundry accounts. For, (1.) We ſhall by this means the better apprehend the meaning of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and many times better diſcern the reaſon of ſome particular Laws, and ſee in the whole Syſtem and Doctrine of the Sacrifices a greater Congruity, and Harmony, and Conſiſtence than we could do otherwiſe. And this will render the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this part of the Law more entertaining to us. (2.) We ſhall better underſtand the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Doctrine. For here are many things that point at things to come to paſs in the days of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and that referr to his Sufferings
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94724:297"/> and Death, and the atonement he made by the Sacrifice of himſelf. And there are many paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages in the New Teſtament, eſpecially in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> which will by this means be better underſtood. I have often thought the Book of <hi>Leviticus</hi> an excellent Comment on the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> (3.) We may hence be farther convinced of the Divine Perfections. Of God's <hi>purity,</hi> who declares his hatred of Sin, by requiring piacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Sacrifices to make atonement, not thinking it fit it ſhould go altogether unpuniſhed. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, we may clearly ſee the <hi>Divine Mercy;</hi> that God would accept any Sacrifice, is a great favour, and a greater ſtill that he requires ſuch as are not coſtly and rare, and allows of a meaner Offering from the poor and indigent. I will not purſue this matter: Otherwiſe 'twere eaſie to give farther inſtances of the great uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of the knowledge of theſe things.</p>
                     <p>The nine firſt Chapters of this Book are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſpent on this Subject. We have an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Death of <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> for offering ſtrange fire, <hi>ch.</hi> 10. Of the Beaſts that were clean and unclean for food, <hi>ch.</hi> 11. The Law of Purification after Child-birth, <hi>ch.</hi> 12. And that concerning Leproſie, and cleanſing the Leper, <hi>ch.</hi> 13.14. Of legal Impurities, and the cleanſing of them, <hi>ch.</hi> 15. And that of the day of expiation, and the ſervice required there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, <hi>ch.</hi> 16. We have alſo a Law (diſpenſed with afterwards) requiring the bloud of Beaſts
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:94724:298"/> ſlain for food in the Wilderneſs, to be brought to the Tabernacle; And another forbidding the Eating of bloud, <hi>&amp;c. ch.</hi> 17. And then follows the Law concerning unlawfull Marriages, <hi>ch.</hi> 18. Many other Laws are repeated, <hi>ch.</hi> 19. And wicked Practices forbid and denounced againſt, <hi>ch.</hi> 20. We have alſo an account of the Mourning of the Prieſts, of their Marriages, and the blemiſhes which hinder them from miniſtring in their Office, <hi>ch.</hi> 21. Which is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry inſtructive to thoſe of the Clergy, and may well awaken them to take the utmoſt care to be holy and exemplary, and to ſhun what is a fault, or hath any appearance of Evil. Then follow Laws concerning Sacrifices and ſolemn and appointed Feſtivals, and many other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Statutes and Precepts, <hi>ch.</hi> 22.23, 24, 25. And after theſe things the Bleſſings of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and Miſchiefs of Diſobedience, are moſt pathetically laid before the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> ch. 26. And the Book ends with a Chapter concerning <hi>Vows,</hi> and <hi>devoted</hi> things, and ſuch as were ſet a-part to an <hi>holy</hi> uſe.</p>
                     <p>Here is enough in this Book to invite and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, and highly entertain all thoſe Men who are inquiſitive into Theological Truths, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially thoſe which relate to the Prieſthood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to his Death, and his Interceſſion at God's right hand. Here is a Book fraught with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of excellent Precepts, and that is full of Symbols and Repreſentations of better things to come.</p>

                     <p>We have next a Relation of the Spies ſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Promiſed Land; Of their Inſtructions, Of their Doings and Report of the Land; Of the People's murmuring hereupon; Of God's juſt Diſpleaſure, and the Effects of it; Of the Interceſſion of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and great Folly of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> ch. 13, and 14.</p>
                     <p>The fifteenth Chapter lays before us ſundry Laws, <hi>viz.</hi> That concerning the Meat-offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring as that Offering was an attendant upon a Bloody Sacrifice.

                     <p>After this we have a Relation of <hi>Balak</hi>'s ſending to <hi>Balaam</hi> to curſe the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> Of <hi>Balaam</hi>'s Journey, and <hi>Balak</hi>'s Diſappointment.

                     <p>Next to this we have an account of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in order to the dividing the Land among them, <hi>ch.</hi> 26. And the Law of Inheritances upon occaſion of the ſuit of the Daughters of <hi>Zelophehad,</hi> ch. 27.</p>
                     <p>In the two next Chapters we have a more particular account than was given before of the Stated <hi>Holocauſts,</hi> and the Meat and Drink-offerings pertaining thereunto. This is follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a Law concerning Vows, <hi>ch.</hi> 30.</p>
                     <p>We have after this an account of the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> Conqueſt over the <hi>Midianites,</hi> and a Law concerning the dividing the Spoil, <hi>ch.</hi> 31.</p>
                     <p>Next follows the Requeſt of the <hi>Reubenites</hi> and <hi>Gadites,</hi> and the ſucceſs of it; and an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Journeyings of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the Wilderneſs; Of the Borders of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Land, and the names of the Men which ſhould divide it; Of the <hi>Levites</hi> Cities, and the Cities of Refuge, with the Law concerning
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:94724:375"/> Murther; Of the Inheritance of Daughters, and the Marriage of Heireſſes in their own Tribe, which is followed with an account how the Daughters of <hi>Zelophehad</hi> were married, <hi>ch.</hi> 32, 33, 34, 35, 36.</p>
                     <p>By what hath been ſaid any Man will ſee that this Book is very fitly called NUMBERS. For here we have the number of the twelve Tribes taken no leſs than three times, <hi>ch.</hi> 1. <hi>ch.</hi> 2. and <hi>ch.</hi> 26. And the <hi>Levites</hi> are num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred as often <hi>ch.</hi> 3, 4, 26. We have alſo ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things numbred. The things that were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, and the Princes, who offered thoſe things, at the Dedication of the Altar, <hi>ch.</hi> 7. The Spoils taken in the War with <hi>Midian,</hi> ch. 31. And all the ſtated <hi>Holocauſts</hi> that were yearly offered up, <hi>ch.</hi> 28, 29. Not to mention the Number and Names of the Cities of <hi>Levites,</hi> and of <hi>Refuge,</hi> and the particulars of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> Marches or Journeyings in the Wilderneſs.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are the principal Matters contained in this Book, which, if duly conſidered, will be of great uſe to us for the better governing our ſelves, as well as for the more clear under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the other parts of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. It is not to be expected I ſhould in this place make Reflections upon all the Particulars which are laid before us in this Book. It may ſuffice, that I lay before the Reader ſome few Particulars, and ſhew, how very much they tend to the uſe of Life, and ſerve to engage us to ſtrict Obedience to the Will of God.
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:94724:376"/> And for the other I referr the Reader to the following Notes.</p>
                     <p>I might here ſhew the admirable uſe that is to be made of the Relation of the numbring the People, and order of their Camp. For here is much of God's ſpecial Providence to be obſerved from thoſe Relations, which we paſs over in reading the Scriptures with too great Negligence. And there are many parts of the Holy Writ, which we paſs over with little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, that are very inſtructive to us. But I will not inſiſt upon this matter in this place I ſhall eſpecially conſider the following Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. The ſetting aſide the <hi>Levites</hi> to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, their Charge and Service. This ſpake God's great care of his People, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point an Order of Men to attend upon his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and to wait on his Sanctuary. And it does alſo inſtruct thoſe that Miniſter in Holy Things, not onely to conſider how they were called to that Holy Office, but to conſider al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo how they diſcharge it. The Particulars re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to this Order of Men are very inſtructive to the People alſo. They were not numbred among the reſt, having no Inheritance as the other Tribes had: They were to attend upon their Office in the ſervice of God and his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; It was therefore the People's part to be kind to them, and there are in the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> many Precepts to this purpoſe. They were not onely obliged to pay them their Tithes (in
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:94724:376"/> which even in ſome of the worſt times they were ſcrupulouſly carefull) but to aſſiſt them upon other occaſions that they might attend upon God's Service. This teacheth the People to communicate of their Temporal Things ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry freely to thoſe that watch over their Souls, and to honour them greatly for the ſake of their Work and their Maſter.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. That Law concerning the removing the Unclean from the Camp, <hi>chap.</hi> 5. This is very inſtructive to the Governors and Miniſters of the Church: It is not fit that Profane and Scandalous Sinners ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to partake of the holieſt things. 'Tis very much the duty of thoſe concerned, and the Intereſt of the whole Church that thoſe ſhould be debarred from her Communion who are notoriouſly ſcandalous. I know very well that that Law made a difference in the Unclean, and that there was a difference as to the Camps alſo, and 'twill well become us to obſerve it: But ſtill we muſt do all we poſſibly can to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude thoſe from the participation of Holy Things who live in contradiction to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of our Holy Religion.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. The Law concerning <hi>Reſtitution</hi> in caſe of a Treſpaſs mentioned in the ſame Chapter. This is of great uſe to us, and ſhews us the abſolute neceſſity of making reſtitution for any <hi>wrong</hi> or <hi>injury</hi> that we have done. By this Law he that had done the wrong was obliged to make Reſtitution to the injured perſon; and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:94724:377"/> he is directed what to doe in caſe the injured perſon could not be found. 'Twas not his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing his ſin, not his Sacrifice with that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion that would procure his Pardon if he did not make Reſtitution, as he is directed there. This is the Doctrine of the Law, and of the Prophets alſo, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.15. as well as of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> Luk. 18.8. Rom. 13.8, 9. This is a moſt unqueſtionable truth, and that the Reader ought to lay to Heart.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. The paſſages, related <hi>ch.</hi> 11, 12. are of great moment towards the awakening us to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void Murmuring, Diſcontent, and Sedition. We have ſevere Examples related there of the ſad effects of thoſe ſins; and the Miſchiefs that follow upon ſuch Crimes are unſpeakable. No Man can tell where his Diſcontent will ſtop, or what will be the effects of it. Let us ſee how the Apoſtle applies this; <hi>Neither murmur ye as ſome of them alſo murmured, and were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed of the deſtroyer. Now all theſe things happened unto them for enſamples; and they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come. Wherefore let him that thinketh he ſtandeth take heed leſt he fall,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.10, 11, 12.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. The Account we have of the Spies ſent into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and of their Report of it; and what followed thereupon, <hi>ch.</hi> 13, 14. This repreſents to us the great miſchief of Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and Diſtruſt, and contempt of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven. Let us ſee how the Author
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:94724:377"/> of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> applies this; <hi>To whom ſware he that they ſhould not enter into his reſt, but to them that believed not? So we ſee they could not enter in becauſe of unbelief. Let us therefore fear, leſt a promiſe being left us of entring into his reſt, any of you ſhould ſeem to come ſhort of it;</hi> Heb. 3.18, 19. and ch. 4.1. It follows, <hi>Let us therefore labour to enter into that reſt, leſt any man fall after the ſame example of unbelief,</hi> v. 11. Thoſe Men that went to ſee the Land owned it to be a good Land, and brought ſome of the Fruit thereof thence. But after all, they diſcouraged the People from the difficulties that would attend their Conqueſt of it, notwithſtanding the many Experiences which they had received of the Power and Providence of God. Theſe Men died by the Plague in the Wilderneſs, the murmuring <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> wandered about in it till they were conſumed, and they were a ſad example of Diſtruſt and Unbelief.</p>
                     <p n="6">VI. The account we have of the Rebellion of <hi>Korah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> ch. 16. This Relation is of great moment to keep Men from the like ſin for the time to come. Theſe Men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> whom God had choſen. The Rebels were ſwallowed up by the Earth, and conſumed with Fire from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and God took care for the perpetuating the Memory of their ſin, and aſſerting the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine right of the Prieſthood. <hi>They envyed Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in the Camp, and Aaron the ſaint of the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:94724:378"/> Lord. The earth opened and ſwallowed up Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, and covered the company of Abiram: And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burnt up the wicked,</hi> Pſ. 106.16, 17, 18. God would have the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> keep up the Memory of theſe things, and learn from this ſad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, to have due regard to them whom he choſe to Miniſter in Holy Things. And to this purpoſe he commands that Plates ſhould be made of the Cenſers of the Rebels for the Altar of Burnt-offering, that ſo there might remain a Memorial of this fatal Rebellion in the view of the People. He cauſed alſo <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Rod to flouriſh, and to be preſerved as a token againſt the Rebels. And upon that follows a moſt particular account <hi>ch.</hi> 18. of the Honorary Maintenance of the Prieſts. Such care God thought fit to take to vindicate the Prieſts, his Servants, and to keep up the Memory of this Relation.</p>
                     <p n="7">VII. The account we have of the People's being bitten with the Fiery Serpents, and heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by looking upon the Brazen Serpent, <hi>ch.</hi> 21. This cure was (as the <hi>Jews</hi> call it) a Miracle in a Miracle. The Brazen Serpent was a Type of the Death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> (Joh. 3.14.) by whoſe Stripes we are healed: This Brazen Serpent is called by the Author of the Book of Wiſdom, <hi>A Sign of Salvation:</hi> It was <hi>put upon a Pole,</hi> or <hi>ſet up for a Sign,</hi> and he that looked upon it <hi>lived,</hi> i. e. Recovered of the harm he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the bite of the Fiery Serpent. <hi>He
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:94724:378"/> that turned himſelf toward it was not ſaved by the thing that he ſaw, but by thee that art the Saviour of all,</hi> Wiſdom 16.6, 7. Thus did <hi>God, ſending his own ſon in the likeneſs of ſinfull fleſh, and for ſin condemned ſin in the fleſh,</hi> Rom. 8.3.</p>
                     <p n="8">VIII. The account of <hi>Balak</hi>'s ſending to <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam</hi> to curſe the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and his coming to him upon this occaſion, and what he ſaid and did, follows in Chapters 22, 23, 24. And that Relation is of great uſe to us, and ſuch as well deſerves our ſerious reflecting upon. It lets us know, that we need not fear the Curſes of a falſe Prophet, nor the attempts of our moſt powerfull Enemies whiles we do adhere to God, and keep his Laws. God will ſo long defend us, and then we need not fear what Man can do unto us. We have alſo in that Relation ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny excellent Prophecies, and one particularly of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> of which the Reader will find an account in the Notes in their proper place.</p>
                     <p n="9">IX. The account of the Whoredom and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry of the People at <hi>Shittim,</hi> ch. 25. We have there a particular account of the ſin, and very exemplary puniſhment of the People for their Wickedneſs. And the Reader will eaſily believe, that this was contrived by <hi>Balaam</hi> from what hath been ſaid to that purpoſe in the No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

He took the onely courſe that was left, and that was to tempt them by the Women of <hi>Midian</hi> to Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:94724:379"/> firſt, and then to Idolatry: The Beauty of the Women was the firſt ſna<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e, and thence they were drawn on to commit Idolatry; <hi>They called the people to the ſacrifices of their Gods: And the people did eat, and bowed down to their Gods.</hi> Thus were they <hi>joined unto Baal Peor,</hi> and <hi>did eat the ſacrifices of the dead,</hi> Pſ. 106.28. Thus did the People fall by their own Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, whom <hi>Balaam</hi> and <hi>Balak</hi> could never have harmed any other way. So true are the words of <hi>Solomon, Righteouſneſs exalteth a nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but ſin is a reproach to any people,</hi> Prov. 14.34. This paſſage deſerves great conſideration.</p>
                     <p>It is not onely the <hi>Duty</hi> but the <hi>Intereſt</hi> of Kings and Governours to encourage Men in the exerciſe of true Religion, and by all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ways and means to ſuppreſs Vice and all Profaneneſs. Where-ever a People are profane they are weak at the ſame time. Beſides, that they by their Wickedneſs call down the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of Heaven, their very Wickedneſs does infeeble them, and render them an eaſie Prey to their Enemies. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were ſtrong while Innocent, when they had forſaken their God they fell: Let us hear what <hi>Balaam</hi> was forc'd to ſay before their Whoredom and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry; <hi>He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he ſeen perverſeneſs in Iſrael. The Lord his God is with him, and the ſhout of a king is among them. God brought them out of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt: He hath as it were the ſtrength of an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn: ſurely there is no enchantment againſt Jacob,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:94724:379"/> neither is there any divination againſt Iſrael <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                           </gap> Behold, the people ſhall riſe up as a great Lion, and lift up himſelf as a young Lion: He ſhall not lie down till he eat of the prey, and drink the blood of the ſlain,</hi> Numb. 23.21, 22, 23, 24. This was the condition of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> but alas they ſoon fell by their own Follies, whom no Power or Malice of their Enemies could have hurt.</p>
                     <p>There is nothing a plainer and more incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable Truth than this, That true Religion and Vertue is not onely the Glory but the Strength and Safety of any Nation or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. On the other hand, Vice and Wickedneſs, Profaneneſs and Diſcontent are the greateſt Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs and the ſaddeſt Preſages of the Ruin of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny People. The Hiſtory of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in this Book will confirm any conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Man in this belief. Here we have a Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their <hi>Follies</hi> and their <hi>Wandrings,</hi> of their <hi>Vices</hi> and their <hi>Plagues,</hi> of their <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment:</hi> They were delivered from the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians,</hi> and from <hi>Amalek;</hi> They needed not to fear their Enemies about them. They fell indeed in the <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> but they fell as the <hi>Jews</hi> ſay a drunken Man does; he needs none to throw him down, he falls of himſelf. They fell by their own Luſt, their Diſcontent, their Profaneneſs and Idolatry. God grant that we, when we ſeem to ſtand, may take heed leſt we fall.</p>

                     <head>THE General Argument OF THE Fifth Book of <hi>MOSES,</hi> CALLED DEUTERONOMY.</head>
                     <p>THIS Book is called <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> which, in the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports a Repetition of the Law; And it is ſo called very fitly. There be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this Divine Book a Repetition not onely of many Facts, which had paſſed before, but of many Laws alſo which were mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                     <p>When and where theſe words were ſpoken, we are told <hi>ch.</hi> 1.1, 3. <hi>Moſes</hi> puts the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> in mind of God's promiſe, of the choice of Rulers, the ſending Spies, and their Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. He goes on to mind them of their Paſſage by the Country of <hi>Eſau,</hi> and their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over the Brook <hi>Zered;</hi> And their Victory
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:94724:484"/> over <hi>Sihon.</hi> And for their farther encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to truſt in God for the future, he relates the Conqueſt of <hi>Og,</hi> and the diſtribution of the conquered Land: As alſo his Command to <hi>Joſhua;</hi> and he relates how he was barred from entring into the promiſed Land, <hi>chap.</hi> 1, 2, 3.</p>
                     <p>Then follows a moſt pathetical Exhortation to Obedience, and Caution againſt Idolatry, with an account of the Cities of Refuge ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part on this ſide of <hi>Jordan. Moſes</hi> proceeds to mind them of the Covenant in <hi>Horeb,</hi> and repeats to them the Ten Commandments, and preſſeth them to Obedience, particularly to the Love and Fear of God: They are warned againſt Communion with the Nations, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of Victory, <hi>chap.</hi> 4, 5, 6, 7.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Moſes</hi> goes on to preſs the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and warns them not to forget God in their plenty, and not to conceit well of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to that purpoſe minds them of their frequent Rebellions. He farther relates the Mercy of God in reſtoring the Two Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and ſeparating the <hi>Levites,</hi> and from ſeveral Arguments proceeds to move them to Obedience, <hi>chap.</hi> 8, 9, 10, 11.</p>
                     <p>He commands them to deſtroy all Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Idolatry, and to ſhew due regard to the place which God ſhou'd chooſe to place his Name there; And not to ſpare the Enticers to Idolatry, nor the City that falls into it; He forbids them the disfiguring themſelves in
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:94724:484"/> Mourning for the dead; He lets them know what Creatures may and may not be eaten; And gives them farther direction as to the Tithe of the third year, <hi>chap.</hi> 12, 13, 14.</p>
                     <p>He proceeds to ſpeak of the year of Releaſe of <hi>Hebrew</hi> Servants; of the Firſtlings of the Cattel; of the ſeveral Feaſts; of Judges and Judgment; of Idolatry, and the Puniſhment thereof; of hard Controverſies, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination thereof; of the Choice and Duty of a King, <hi>chap.</hi> 15, 16, 17.</p>
                     <p>Of the Portion of the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Levites;</hi> The <hi>Meſſiah</hi> promiſed; The way of judging of a falſe Prophet; of the Cities of Refuge; of removing the Land-mark; of Witneſſes, and the Puniſhment of a falſe Witneſs; of Warring, and the part of the Prieſt and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers on this occaſion; of the Uſage to be ſhewed towards thoſe they War with; of the Trees that are to be ſpared in a Siege; of the Expiation of an uncertain Murder; of a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Woman to be taken for a Wife; of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Son, and of him that is hanged, <hi>chap.</hi> 18, 19, 20, 21.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Moſes</hi> proceeds to exhort the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to Obedience, and denounceth Wrath againſt him that ſhould flatter himſelf in an Evil courſe, and ſhews the Miſeries which their Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence would bring upon them. He encourageth the Penitent; ſets Life and Death before them, and continues to exhort them with great ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemence to Obedience, as the way to be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, <hi>chap.</hi> 29, 30.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Moſes</hi> encourageth the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> delivers a Copy of the Law to the Prieſts, with a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to read it publickly every Seventh year: He fore-tells the Apoſtaſie of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and appoints a <hi>Song</hi> as a Witneſs againſt them. The <hi>Song</hi> follows, ſetting forth the Divine Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and God's Care of the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> as alſo the Rebellions of the People: <hi>Moſes</hi> is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to go up to <hi>Nebo,</hi> to take a view of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi>
                        <pb n="393" facs="tcp:94724:485"/> before his approaching Death. He ſets forth the glorious Majeſty of God; bleſſeth the <hi>Tribes;</hi> ſhews the great Priviledge of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> chap. 31, 32, 33.</p>
                     <p>After <hi>Moſes</hi> had taken a view of the Land, he died. We have after this an account of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>ial and Age; of the Mourning of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; of his Succeſſor, and an Encomium of <hi>Moſes,</hi> chap. 34.</p>
                     <p>Among other Objections againſt theſe Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and which are advanced to ſhew, that <hi>Moſes</hi> was not the Author of them, I find this is one, That there are in it a great many <hi>repetitions,</hi> which <hi>Moſes</hi> would not be guilty of. And therefore 'tis ſuppoſed rather a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of ſeveral Hands, and of Rolls miſpla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, than the Work of ſo great and accurate a Perſon as <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now becauſe this Objection, if it have any force, will bear hardeſt upon this Book called <hi>Deuteronomy;</hi> therefore I have reſerved the Conſideration of it to this place, and ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it more particularly with relation to the following Book. And to that purpoſe ſhall deſire the Reader to conſider the following Particulars in order to his ſatisfaction in this matter.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. That though here are many Repetitions of things mentioned before, yet here is to be found very much <hi>new matter</hi> that had not been mentioned at all in the foregoing Books. And ſo far this Divine Book is unexceptionable as
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:94724:486"/> to the Charge brought againſt it. I ſhall not enlarge here, but juſt touch upon ſome Heads. Though Idolatry were forbidden be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, yet we find not ſo expreſs a Law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Enticers to it, and concerning the Apoſtate City, as we find here, <hi>chap.</hi> 13. The Laws of abiding by the determination of the Judges, and of Electing a King, (<hi>chap.</hi> 17.) are new Laws. The Prediction of a Succeſſion of Prophets is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o likewiſe, <hi>chap.</hi> 18. And ſo is the Law concerning the Puniſhment of Falſe-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, <hi>chap.</hi> 19.16. And ſo are thoſe Laws concerning the Prieſts and Officers in time of War, and that relating to the beſieging a City, <hi>chap.</hi> 20. The ſame may be ſaid of the Laws concerning the Expiation of an uncertain Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; of a Captive taken to Wife; of the Right of the Firſt-born; of the rebellious Son, and thoſe that were hanged, mentioned <hi>chap.</hi> 21. We ſhall find more ſuch Laws not mentioned any-where before, <hi>chap.</hi> 22. and <hi>chap.</hi> 23. and <hi>chap.</hi> 24. and <hi>chap.</hi> 25, and 26, and 27, and 31. The Song of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Bleſſing of the Tribes, are not to be found in the foregoing Books. Here is in this Book very much mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter intirely new.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. Another great part of this Book conſiſts of Motives to Obedience. And though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to this purpoſe had been ſaid before, yet nothing in compariſon to what is ſaid in this Book. And thus far again this Book is unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptionable as to the Charge brought againſt
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:94724:486"/> it. Here are to be found the moſt pathetick, and powerfull, and preſſing Motives to Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; of which ſee <hi>chap.</hi> 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, and 29. And who ever will take the pains to go over the ſeveral Topicks here laid before us, will own this to be true: And the Miniſters that labour in the Word and Doctrine, may hence furniſh themſelves with very moving Arguments to perſwade the People to obey the Laws of God, and to be ſeriouſly Religious. And this part of the Book did very well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the inſpired Writer of it. For this Man of God did purſue the great Purpoſe of his Miſſion, not onely when he laid before the People the Divine Laws, but when he perſwaded them to obey them. He was God's Embaſſador, and 'twas not onely his buſineſs to declare God's Will, but to preſs thoſe to whom he had done that, to obey it. For this Exhortation to Obedience hath a direct ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to obtain the great End of the wiſe Law-giver. For he muſt be ſuppoſed always to appoint his Laws in order to have them kept. And to that purpoſe they who preach theſe Laws, directly ſerve the End of their Miniſtry, when they repreſent to the People how much it is their Intereſt and their Duty to yield a ready and unfeigned Obedience to them.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. As to thoſe parts of this Book that are <hi>Repetitions,</hi> they are either Repetitions of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Fact,</hi> or they are Repetitions of <hi>Laws.</hi>
                        <pb n="396" facs="tcp:94724:487"/> Of each of theſe 'tis no difficult thing to give a very fair account.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> As to Repetitions of Matters of <hi>Fact,</hi> with which this Book begins; and we have ſuch Repetitions in the firſt three Chapters of this Book. But then theſe are not bare and jojune Repetitions, but are made uſe of to a noble purpoſe, as will appear to the diligent Reader; <hi>viz.</hi> To encourage the People from the Conſideration of what God had already done to hope and truſt in him for the time to come. So that here we have the Alpplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Hiſtory of thoſe Facts to an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent End and Purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to the Repetitions of <hi>Laws,</hi> 't<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> as eaſie to give an account of them alſo. We ſhall find very great advantages in theſe Repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions, if we read theſe Holy Books with that diligence and application which we ought to do. As for inſtance: (1.) Theſe Repetitions of Laws, formerly given, are ſuch, that they give a more clear and diſtinct meaning of thoſe Laws, than was to be collected from what had been ſaid. So that the Repetition does lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Reader an Explication of the repeated Law. Of this I ſhall give ſome inſtances, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.16. <hi>He that ſtealeth a man,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſhall ſurely be put to death. Onkelos</hi> renders it, <hi>He that ſtealeth one of the children of Iſrael.</hi> I ſhou'd in this caſe be ready to ſuſpect that Paraphraſt as partial, and giving too limited a ſenſe of thoſe words. But when <hi>Moſes</hi> repeats the Law,
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:94724:487"/> he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ixeth the Senſe, and confirms that Senſe which that Paraphraſt hath given. For thus he hath it: <hi>If a man be found ſtealing any of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This Law is repeated and explained in <hi>Deuteronomy:</hi> There 'tis ſaid, <hi>When thou ſendeſt him out free from thee, thou ſhalt not let him go away empty: thou ſhall furniſh him liberally out of thy flock,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>chap.</hi> 15.12, 13, 14. Again, <hi>If thou meet thine enemies ox or his aſs going aſtray,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.5, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This Law is repeated thus, <hi>Thou ſhalt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                     <p n="4">IV. Theſe Repetitions do mightily engage the diligent and carefull Reader to compare Spiritual things with Spiritual. God is not tied to our Rules and Methods, to deliver his Laws, as we teach Arts and Sciences by certain Rules, which the Wit of Man hath deviſed. 'Tis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that he deliver his Will as he thinks fit; And if He think fit to do it by Parts, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſundry Occaſions, 'twill well become us to uſe the greater diligence in collecting and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things together, that we may by this means arrive at the ſenſe and meaning of the whole Revelation. If theſe things be duly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, we ſhall not find any force in this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular and looſe Objection which is brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this Book. And I ſhall onely on this occaſion add,</p>
                     <p n="5">
                        <pb n="399" facs="tcp:94724:488"/>V. That if theſe Repetitions had not been written by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and had been put together by an uncertain Collector of ſome looſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, they might have been omitted eaſily. 'Tis not very likely we had ever had theſe Books in this Order, if <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf had not been the Author of them. Here's no ſhew of worldly Artifice or Craft; nothing appears here like Artifice: And the Way and Order in which theſe things are delivered, will hardly allow us (if we conſider things with Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) to call the <hi>Author,</hi> or <hi>Authority,</hi> of theſe Holy Books in queſtion. I am of belief, that the little variety we find in the four Goſpels, is ſo far from being an Objection againſt thoſe Books, that they rather confirm us in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of them, as Books that were not compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>I return to this Book called <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> which lies before us. A Book that hath all the Marks and Signatures of a Divine Original, and an inſpired Author, as <hi>Moſes</hi> was. 'Tis hardly poſſible for any man to read it with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny care, but he muſt be the better for it. 'Tis fraught with admirable Precepts of Piety, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, Charity, Humanity, and Fortitude. Theſe Precepts are backed with Motives to Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="400" facs="tcp:94724:489"/> and moving. He muſt be very ſtupid and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligate that does not embrace it with the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Veneration. How does <hi>Moſes,</hi> this Man of God, Court the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to be Obedient and Happy! What wondrous Care does he ſhew! He ſpeaks as becomes the greateſt Prophet, and one Divinely inſpired. <hi>Take heed to thy ſelf, and keep thy ſoul diligently, leſt thou forget the things which thine eyes have ſeen,</hi> (chap. 4.9.) <hi>Take ye therefore good heed unto your ſelves,</hi> (v. 15.) <hi>Beware that thou forget not the Lord thy God,</hi> (chap. 8.11.) <hi>Take heed to your ſelves, that your heart be not deceived,</hi> (chap. 11.16.) He calls Heaven and Earth to witneſs againſt them: He lays before them Life and Death, Bleſſing and a Curſe.</p>
                     <p>To conclude: Here's enough to engage the Reader, that hath any ſparks of Goodneſs left. And for the Pious Reader, his Heart muſt be melted down when he reads it, and burn with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him. Here's nothing required ſo much as an honeſt Mind. The Book is generally plain, and very eaſie to be underſtood. God grant we may read it with due care, and not put a bar to our profiting by it.</p>

The Journeys of them, which were not ſtopped; (<hi>v.</hi> 6.) And that they journeyed to places well watered alſo, (<hi>v.</hi> 6, 7.) And though indeed <hi>Aaron</hi> died, yet his Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood continued in <hi>Eleazar.</hi> And as God gave them a token of his favour in the Ark of the Covenant, ſo he gave them another in ſeparating the <hi>Levites</hi> to bear that Ark, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (v. 8.)
